4D Vortex Sheet Projection: Rigorous Derivation of 4-fold Enhancement

This calculation demonstrates that a 2D vortex sheet in 4D space projects
onto the 3D hypersurface with exactly 4Γ total circulation through four
distinct physical mechanisms.

Mathematical Framework:
- 4D coordinates: (x, y, z, w) where our universe is the w=0 slice
- Vortex sheet: 2D surface extending in (z, w) directions centered @ (x,y)=(0,0)
- Sheet parameterization: z ∈ (-∞, ∞), w ∈ (-L, L) with L→∞

        v_w(r, w) = -Γ/(4πr²) (pointing into the sheet)

        By 4D Helmholtz theorem, this drainage induces a circulation in
        the (x,y) plane. The key is that in 4D, the curl of a radial
        flow has a component in the perpendicular 2-plane.

        Specifically, for a sink line in 4D:
        ∇₄ × v₄ = ε₄ᵢⱼₖₗ ∂ᵢvⱼ ≠ 0

        The induced circulation is exactly Γ by flux conservation:
        what goes into w must come from tangential flow in (x,y).
