\section{Introduction to Mathematical Framework}

This work develops a concise mathematical framework for how higher–dimensional vortex structures manifest in three spatial dimensions. The central object is a codimension–2 vortex sheet $\Sigma\subset\mathbb{R}^4$ with sheet strength $\Gamma$, observed on a three–dimensional slice $\Pi=\{w=0\}$. Our aims are to keep assumptions explicit, maintain dimensional consistency, and produce testable statements with controlled error estimates.

\paragraph{Scope.}
The framework provides:
(i) a representation of vortex sheets in $\mathbb{R}^4$ suitable for projection,
(ii) a map from 4D structure to 3D observables on $\Pi$,
(iii) a decomposition of slice fields into divergence–free (circulatory) and gradient (potential or ``drainage'') parts, and
(iv) scaling relations with explicit error control in the thin/flat limit.
Small parameters are the core–to–loop aspect ratio $\xi/\rho$ and the slice–scale curvature $\kappa\rho$, with typical remainder terms $O\!\left((\xi/\rho)^2+(\kappa\rho)^2\right)$.

\paragraph{Projection principle.}
When a small loop $\gamma\subset\Pi$ links the projected intersection $\Sigma\cap\Pi$ once, the circulation measured on the slice equals the sheet strength:
\[
\oint_{\gamma} \mathbf{v}\cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell}\;=\;\Gamma
\quad\text{(thin/flat limit),}
\]
with the total arising from two equal \emph{half–space} contributions across the slice, each $\Gamma/2$. Potential (drainage) adjustments on the slice are gradient fields and contribute zero to the loop integral.

\paragraph{Kernel normalization (summary).}
Where an explicit kernel is required, we use the correctly normalized 4D$\to$3D Biot–Savart–type expression for an axially symmetric configuration, yielding the standard azimuthal profile
\[
v_\theta(\rho)
=\frac{\Gamma}{4\pi\rho}\!\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\rho^2\,dw}{(\rho^2+w^2)^{3/2}}
=\frac{\Gamma}{2\pi\rho}.
\]
The one–sided integrals over $w>0$ and $w<0$ each produce $\Gamma/2$, making the half–space split explicit and consistent with the projection principle above.

\paragraph{Decomposition on the slice.}
Fields on $\Pi$ are organized into a solenoidal component that carries the circulation and a curl–free potential component determined by continuity. Only the solenoidal part contributes to loop integrals; the potential part can influence local velocities and pressures but integrates to zero circulation around closed loops.

\paragraph{Outline and related results.}
Subsequent sections apply the projection principle and kernel identities to derive practical expressions for observables on $\Pi$, quantify finite–core and curvature corrections, and state verification procedures amenable to numerical checks. For hierarchical vortex energetics that lead to the appearance of the golden ratio, a full derivation is provided externally in Norris (2025) \cite{Norris2025GoldenRatio}; this manuscript references that result where relevant without reproducing its proof.

\subsection{Foundational Postulates}
\label{sec:foundational-postulates}

We model a codimension–2 vortex sheet $\Sigma\subset\mathbb{R}^4$ carrying sheet strength $\Gamma$ and observe its manifestation on a three–dimensional slice $\Pi=\{w=0\}$. The following postulates fix the geometric setting, scaling regime, kernel normalization, and the manner in which 4D structure appears to a 3D observer. Throughout, small parameters are the core–to–loop aspect ratio $\xi/\rho$ and the slice–scale curvature $\kappa\rho$, with error terms $O((\xi/\rho)^2+(\kappa\rho)^2)$ unless otherwise noted.

\paragraph{P-1: Geometry and regularity}
\label{post:P1}
The sheet $\Sigma$ is an oriented $C^2$ two–dimensional surface embedded in $\mathbb{R}^4$ with bounded curvature $\kappa$ on the observation scale and an intrinsic core radius $\xi>0$. In the neighborhood of any observation loop $\gamma\subset\Pi$ of radius $\rho$, we assume the \emph{thin/flat} regime
\[
0<\xi \ll \rho, \qquad \kappa\rho \ll 1,
\]
so that local coordinates may be chosen in which $\Sigma$ is well approximated by a flat sheet and higher–order geometric effects are controlled by $O((\xi/\rho)^2+(\kappa\rho)^2)$.

\paragraph{P-2: Sheet strength and circulation}
\label{post:P2}
The sheet carries a constant strength $\Gamma$ (dimension of circulation) defined intrinsically on $\Sigma$. For any small loop $\tilde{\gamma}$ linking $\Sigma$ once in the local normal bundle of $\Sigma$, the circulation of the induced velocity field equals $\Gamma$ in the thin/flat limit. Orientation is fixed so that positive linking yields positive circulation.

\paragraph{P-3: Slice observables and field decomposition}
\label{post:P3}
All observables are evaluated on the slice $\Pi$. The induced velocity on $\Pi$ decomposes uniquely (up to constants) into a solenoidal part and a potential part,
\[
\mathbf{v}\big|_{\Pi} \;=\; \mathbf{v}_\mathrm{sol} \;+\; \nabla\phi,
\qquad \nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{sol}=0, \qquad \nabla\times\nabla\phi=\mathbf{0}.
\]
Only $\mathbf{v}_\mathrm{sol}$ contributes to loop circulation on $\Pi$; the potential (``drainage'') component enforces continuity but integrates to zero around closed curves contained in $\Pi$.

\paragraph{P-4: Kernel normalization (local axisymmetric model)}
\label{post:P4}
In the local axisymmetric model around the intersection $\Sigma\cap\Pi$, the correctly normalized 4D$\!\to$3D Biot–Savart–type kernel produces the standard azimuthal profile on $\Pi$,
\[
v_\theta(\rho)
=\frac{\Gamma}{4\pi\rho}\!\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\rho^2\,dw}{(\rho^2+w^2)^{3/2}}
=\frac{\Gamma}{2\pi\rho},
\]
with one–sided (half–space) integrals over $w>0$ and $w<0$ each yielding $\Gamma/2$. This normalization sets the reference scale for all slice–level measurements and is consistent with Stokes’ theorem on $\Pi$.

\paragraph{P-5: Projection invariance of circulation}
\label{post:P5}
Let $\gamma\subset\Pi$ be any small loop that links $\Sigma\cap\Pi$ once. In the thin/flat limit,
\[
\oint_{\gamma}\mathbf{v}\cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell}\;=\;\Gamma
\;+\; O\!\left((\xi/\rho)^2+(\kappa\rho)^2\right).
\]
Equivalently, the slice circulation is the sum of two equal half–space contributions across $\Pi$, each $\Gamma/2$, while the potential component contributes zero to the loop integral. Thus circulation measured on the slice is \emph{invariant} under projection from the 4D configuration.

\paragraph{P-6: Topology and discreteness of intersections}
\label{post:P6}
Intersections of $\Sigma$ with the slice $\Pi$ are topologically discrete at the observation scale. Linkings of loops in $\Pi$ with $\Sigma\cap\Pi$ are integer–valued. Observable circulation on $\Pi$ is therefore quantized in units of $\Gamma$ per simple linking, with superposition understood in the solenoidal sector.

\paragraph{Reader’s guide.}
For intuition, physical motivation, and unit conventions that complement P-1–P-6, see Subsection~\ref{sec:motivation-conventions}.

\paragraph{Remarks on errors and scaling.}
Under P-1–P-6, all leading predictions on $\Pi$ are controlled by the non-dimensional parameters $\xi/\rho$ and $\kappa\rho$. Unless otherwise specified, higher–order effects are captured by $O((\xi/\rho)^2+(\kappa\rho)^2)$. Where finite–core structure is resolved, moments higher than order two do not affect leading circulation on $\Pi$.

\paragraph{External result used later.}
When hierarchical energetics are discussed, the appearance of the golden ratio is referenced to an external derivation; see Norris (2025) \cite{Norris2025GoldenRatio}. No part of that proof is assumed here; only its statement is cited where needed.

\subsection{Motivation, Regime of Validity, and Conventions}
\label{sec:motivation-conventions}

We model spacetime as a 4D compressible superfluid---an aether---where all forces and particles emerge from the dynamics of topological defects called vortices. Just as whirlpools in water create observable effects through their fluid motion, vortices in the aether manifest as particles and fields. The dynamics naturally separate into five fundamental modes. These modes align with our intuitive quintet:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{SUCK}: irrotational flow creating attractive pressure gradients (gravity)
\item \textbf{SHAKE}: circulation maintaining vortex against pressure for stability/rest energy
\item \textbf{SWIRL}: 4D helical spiral inducing EM effects
\item \textbf{DRAG}: 3D rotational effects like frame-dragging indicating rotation
\item \textbf{WAVE}: oscillatory modes carrying energy as waves, 3D for GW/photons differing in 4D stabilization
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Regime of validity.} All Lorentz-covariant statements below refer to the long-wavelength transverse WAVE sector. Gauge-invariant observables built from $F_{\mu\nu}$ propagate at speed $c$. Bulk adjustments at $v_L\gg c$ are either pure gauge or enter observables only at higher order in $(\xi_c/L)$; no claim is made of full Lorentz symmetry of the underlying medium.

The irrotational flow (``SUCK'') creates attractive pressure gradients analogous to gravity. The circulation (``SHAKE'') maintains stability. The 4D helical (``SWIRL'') induces EM. The solenoidal (``DRAG'') induces rotational effects like frame-dragging. Oscillatory modes (``WAVE'') carry energy as waves, manifesting as gravitational waves or photons.

While we use standard notation ($\Phi$ for scalar potential, $A$ for vector potential) in equations.

\subsubsection{Physical Motivation}

Before presenting the formal postulates, consider this analogy: Imagine you're floating in the ocean when an underwater tectonic shift opens a cavity far away. Two distinct things happen:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Bulk redistribution}: Water quickly rushes in to fill the cavity, adjusting the ocean level everywhere through inward flows (SUCK). If you had a perfect pressure sensor, you'd detect this pressure gradient instantly. But floating on the surface, you don't feel it---you move with the water.
\item \textbf{Surface wave}: Later, a tsunami wave arrives (WAVE), which you definitely feel as it lifts and drops you.
\end{enumerate}

Both phenomena involve the same water, but they represent fundamentally different physics. Our framework captures this duality: gravitational fields are like the bulk rush filling the cavity (established rapidly via SUCK, unobservable locally per equivalence), while gravitational waves/photons are like the tsunami (propagating at $c$ via WAVE, observable). SHAKE maintains the ``whirlpool'' defect stability, SWIRL adds helical EM if rotation present (validated by Kerr BH magnetic fields scaling with spin), DRAG indicates rotation. This duality aligns with the tsunami principle detailed in Section 2.5. Similar to black holes: Non-rotating (Schwarzschild) show no intrinsic magnetic fields ($\sim 10^2 - 10^3$ Gauss from accretion only), while rotating (Kerr) exhibit strong fields ($\sim 10^4 - 10^8$ Gauss) scaling with spin $a$, confirming rotation enables SWIRL EM.

\subsubsection{Apparent instantaneity and causality check}\label{sec:tsunami-causality}

Same medium, different physics---no separate structures needed.

\draw[->] (3,-0.5) -- (3,1.5) node[midway,right] {same medium};
\end{tikzpicture}

\subsubsection{Dimensional Conventions}
\paragraph{Units and Conventions (EM/GEM).} Unless stated otherwise we use Gaussian--cgs units for the electromagnetic field equations and keep $c$ explicit. Thus $\partial_\nu F^{\mu\nu} = (4\pi/c)\, J^\mu$ (Gaussian) $\equiv \mu_0 J^\mu$ (SI). Where $\epsilon$ and $\mu$ appear (e.g., $c = 1/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu}$) they denote effective medium parameters; in Gaussian vacuum set $\epsilon=\mu=1$. Gravitational gravitoelectromagnetic (GEM) sources appear with $16\pi G/c^2$. When $4\pi$ or $\mu_0,\epsilon_0$ appear elsewhere they refer to the corresponding form of the same relation; we avoid mixing forms within a single derivation.

\paragraph{Speed glossary.} $v_L$ --- bulk aether drift speed (unobservable in local experiments); $c$ --- surface wave speed on WAVE (observable, fundamental limit); $v_{\text{eff}}$ --- local effective wave speed set by medium parameters when discussing dispersion.

\paragraph{Units and normalization.} Unless otherwise noted we set $\hbar=m=1$ and reinstate them when needed for clarity; all formulas are consistent with this choice.

The $4D\to3D$ projection of codimension-2 defects necessitates non-standard dimensions for the order parameter $\Psi$. This is not an arbitrary choice but a mathematical requirement:

\textbf{Why $[\Psi] = [L^{-2}]$ is necessary:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item In 4D: vortices are 2D sheets (codimension-2 defects)
\item Surface-like fields naturally scale as $[L^{-2}]$
\item Projection to 3D points requires this scaling for consistency
\item Standard 3D conventions $[M^{1/2} L^{-3/2}]$ fail at vortex intersections
\end{enumerate}

Note that this differs from the standard 3D GP scaling of $[L^{-3/2}]$ (or with mass $[M^{1/2} L^{-3/2}]$), as it reflects the codimension-2 defects in 4D appearing surface-like, ensuring consistent projection to 3D points without extraneous mass dimensions. This choice is verified dimensionally in Table \ref{tab:notation} and supports the quintet modes, e.g., SWIRL's helical phase projecting to EM and DRAG's circulation.

This unconventional choice ensures dimensional consistency throughout the projection mechanism (detailed in Section 2.7) and has been verified through comprehensive symbolic analysis.

The postulates are summarized in the following table:

We will also use the cosmological length scale $\lambda_{\text{cosmo}}$, tied to large-scale matter distribution and bulk-mode dissipation.

For clarity and dimensional consistency, we define the following key quantities. All projections incorporate the healing length $\xi$ to bridge 4D and 3D descriptions. We define the summation operator over projected quantities in the discrete limit, where $i$ indexes vortex intersections. Surface terms vanish in the discrete projection, as there are no infinite boundaries.

The electromagnetic four-potential is written as $A^\mu=(\Phi/c,\mathbf A)$, with $A_\mu = (-\Phi/c,\mathbf A)$.
For healing lengths, we spell out $\xi_c$ (core/drainage) and $\xi_h$ (helical/EM); we avoid generic $\xi$ and never use $\xi_*$.

We distinguish $\xi_c$ (core/drainage scale) from $\xi_h$ (helical/EM scale), and use subscripts throughout to avoid ambiguity. Unless otherwise noted, densities labeled $\rho_0$ are 3D background densities: $\rho_0 := \rho_{3D}^0$.

\subsubsection{Derivation from Aether Dynamics}

From the foundational postulates (P-1 through P-6), we derive the unified field equations governing the dynamics of the 4D compressible superfluid aether. The equations separate into scalar (SUCK), vector (SWIRL/DRAG), and oscillatory (SHAKE/WAVE) sectors, with EM emerging preliminarily in the vector via SWIRL twists. We begin with the continuity and Euler equations (P-1), incorporating vortex sinks (P-2) and dual wave modes (P-3). Using Helmholtz decomposition (P-4), we separate the velocity field into irrotational (scalar $\Phi$ $[L^2 T^{-2}]$) and solenoidal (vector $\mathbf{B}_4$ $[L^2 T^{-2}]$) components, with quantized circulation and helical twists (P-5) providing sources. The dynamics naturally separate into irrotational (SUCK), solenoidal (SWIRL/DRAG), and oscillatory (SHAKE/WAVE) modes, as detailed below. While we reference these modes intuitively in the text, the mathematics uses standard notation without complex quintet forms.

The derivation begins with the 4D equations from P-1 and P-2, now coupled to the vortex core condition $\Psi=0$ at the defect position, incorporating helical twists:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \rho_{4D} + \nabla_4 \cdot (\rho_{4D} \mathbf{v}_4) = -\sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}),
\end{equation}

where $\rho_{4D}$ is the 4D density $[M L^{-4}]$, $\mathbf{v}_4$ the 4-velocity, and $\dot{M}_i = \rho_{4D}^0 \Gamma_i \xi_c^2$ the sink strength (P-2), with the delta supported on the vortex sheet.

The Euler equation is:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \mathbf{v}_4 + (\mathbf{v}_4 \cdot \nabla_4) \mathbf{v}_4 = -\frac{1}{\rho_{4D}} \nabla_4 P - \nabla_4 Q,
\end{equation}

with barotropic EOS $P = (g/2) \rho_{4D}^2 / m$. Here, $m$ is the effective boson mass in the GP description, ensuring $[P] = [M L^{-2} T^{-2}]$ with $[g] = [L^6 T^{-2}]$ and $[\rho_{4D}] = [M L^{-4}]$ (yielding local effective speed $v_{\text{eff}} = \sqrt{g \rho_{4D}^{\text{local}} / m}$ (bulk $v_L = \sqrt{g \rho_{4D}^0 / m}$ potentially $\gg c$; observable modes at $c$ from P-3), and $Q$ the quantum pressure $-(\hbar^2 / (2m)) (\nabla_4^2 \sqrt{\rho_{4D}/m} / \sqrt{\rho_{4D}/m})$. Helical twists from P-5 introduce a chiral term in the vorticity: $\nabla_4 \times \mathbf{v}_4 = \Omega_0 + (\tau c) \mathbf{n}$ (twist density $\tau$ for SWIRL, sourcing EM currents preliminarily; normal to vortex $\mathbf{n}$, scaled by $c$ for observable shear; enables DRAG). The vorticity $\nabla_4 \times \mathbf{v}_4 = \Omega_0 + (\tau c) \mathbf{n}$ arises from P-5 phase windings $\theta = n\phi + \tau w$, where $\tau$ sources EM currents (detailed in 2.3). Helical twists in SWIRL explain chiral vorticity, consistent with Kerr BH magnetic fields scaling with spin (B $\propto$ a, e.g., M87* a$\approx$0.9 strong jets vs. Sgr A* a$\approx$0.1 weak).

Linearize around background $\rho_{4D} = \rho_{4D}^0 + \delta \rho_{4D}$, $\mathbf{v}_4 = \mathbf{0} + \delta \mathbf{v}_4$ (steady state), and vortex perturbation $\delta R$. The linearized continuity is:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \delta \rho_{4D} + \rho_{4D}^0 \nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -\sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}),
\end{equation}

SymPy confirms linearization; code at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}.

The linearized Euler (dropping quadratic terms):

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -v_{\text{eff}}^2 \nabla_4 (\delta \rho_{4D} / \rho_{4D}^0) - \nabla_4 \delta Q,
\end{equation}

where $\delta P = v_{\text{eff}}^2 \delta \rho_{4D}$ from EOS linearization (differentiate $P(\rho_{4D})$ at $\rho_{4D}^0$ gives $\partial P / \partial \rho_{4D} = g \rho_{4D}^0 / m = v_L^2$, local $\rho_{4D}^{\text{local}}$ for $v_{\text{eff}}$ near deficits), and $\delta Q$ the perturbation in quantum pressure. This separation highlights SUCK in density perturbations and SWIRL/DRAG in vorticity sources.

The vortex dynamics, derived from varying the GP functional with boundary $\Psi=0$ on the defect, yield Kelvin wave equations for oscillations:

\begin{equation}
\partial^2 R / \partial t^2 = c^2 \nabla^2 R + f_{\text{bulk}} + \omega^2 \delta R,
\end{equation}

where the bulk coupling term follows from the defect advecting with the local flow (motivated by superfluid vortex dynamics in P-1 and P-5), $c$ is the emergent speed for Kelvin modes (calibrated, independent of $v_L$), and the oscillatory term $\omega^2 \delta R$ provides harmonic restoring force for SHAKE stability, with $\omega \sim v_L / \xi_c$ (arising from the balance of quantum dispersion and interactions in the GP equation (P-1), representing the natural frequency for vortex oscillations against bulk pressure). The linearized vortex equation is $\partial_{tt} \delta R = c^2 \nabla^2 \delta R - (1 / \rho_{4D}^0) \nabla \delta P \cdot n + \omega^2 \delta R$ (coupling term from bulk pressure on defect, with $\delta P$ replacing P for perturbation, and oscillatory term for SHAKE). These Kelvin waves represent WAVE modes, coupling to bulk SUCK via pressure, with SHAKE maintaining core stability.

Apply Helmholtz decomposition (P-4) to $\delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -\nabla_4 \Phi + \nabla_4 \times \mathbf{B}_4$, separating compressible (scalar $\Phi$ $[L^2 T^{-2}]$) and incompressible (vector $\mathbf{B}_4$ $[L^2 T^{-2}]$) parts, now with oscillatory modulation in the phase. Taking $\nabla_4 \cdot$ on Euler gives:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t (\nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4) = -v_{\text{eff}}^2 \nabla_4^2 (\delta \rho_{4D} / \rho_{4D}^0) - \nabla_4^2 \delta Q,
\end{equation}

and substituting $\nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -\nabla_4^2 \Phi$ yields the scalar precursor. From linearized continuity:

\begin{equation}
\nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -\frac{1}{\rho_{4D}^0} \left( \partial_t \delta \rho_{4D} + \sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}) \right).
\end{equation}

Differentiate continuity by $t$:

\begin{equation}
\partial_{tt} \delta \rho_{4D} + \rho_{4D}^0 \partial_t (\nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4) = -\sum_i \partial_t \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}),
\end{equation}

and substitute the Euler divergence:

\begin{equation}
\partial_{tt} \delta \rho_{4D} - \rho_{4D}^0 v_{\text{eff}}^2 \nabla_4^2 (\delta \rho_{4D} / \rho_{4D}^0) = -\sum_i \partial_t \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}) + \rho_{4D}^0 \nabla_4^2 \delta Q.
\end{equation}

Combine with $\nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -\nabla_4^2 \Phi$:

\begin{equation}
\partial_{tt} \Phi - v_{\text{eff}}^2 \nabla_4^2 \Phi = v_{\text{eff}}^2 \sum_i \frac{\dot{M}_i}{\rho_{4D}^0} \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}) + v_{\text{eff}}^2 \nabla_4^2 \delta Q / \rho_{4D}^0.
\end{equation}

Note: The linearization procedure and resulting wave equations have been verified using SymPy symbolic computation. While we use terms like "aether" for historical context, this is simply a mathematical model of a compressible medium. SymPy confirms the combination; code at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}.

\subsubsection{Scalar Sector: Gravitational Attraction}

This sector corresponds to pure SUCK: irrotational flow ($\nabla \times \mathbf{v} = 0$) creating attractive pressure gradients, analogous to the cavity-filling rush of water in the tsunami analogy (inward flow to fill density deficits). This ties to particles as processes: mass emerges from the deficit volume in stable flow patterns around vortices. Contrast with the EM sector (2.3), where sources include helical SWIRL-enhanced circulation (preliminary).

From the Helmholtz decomposition, the scalar potential $\Phi$ satisfies the wave equation derived from combining the linearized continuity and Euler:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{v_{\text{eff}}^2} \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \Phi = \frac{v_{\text{eff}}^2}{\rho_{4D}^0} \sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^3(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i),
\end{equation}

after 3D projection (detailed in Section 2.7). In the static limit, this reduces to the Poisson equation:

\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G \rho_{\text{body}},
\end{equation}

where $\rho_{\text{body}} = \sum_i m_i \delta^3(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i)$ is the effective matter density from aggregated deficits, with $m_i \approx \rho_0 V_{\text{deficit}}$ and calibration $G = c^2 / (4\pi \bar{n} \bar{m} \xi_c^2)$ (Section 2.8). The acceleration is $\mathbf{a} = -\nabla \Phi$, mimicking Newtonian gravity. In the static limit, this mimics Newtonian gravity via SUCK-induced inflows. SymPy verifies the derivation from linearized equations; code at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}.

\subsubsection{Vector Sector: SWIRL and DRAG Effects}

This sector corresponds to SWIRL and DRAG: SWIRL as 4D helical circulation inducing electromagnetic effects (preliminary, via twists), and DRAG as solenoidal circulation ($\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} = 0$) inducing 3D rotational effects like frame-dragging, analogous to a whirlpool dragging surrounding fluid and indicating rotation that enables SWIRL. For the vector sector, vorticity $\nabla \times \mathbf{v} = \boldsymbol{\omega}$ is sourced by moving vortices (P-5). Define $\mathbf{A} = \sum_i \mathbf{B}_{4,i} / \xi_c$ $[L T^{-1}]$ (rescaling by division with $\xi_c$ $[L]$ from P-5's projection reduces dimensions from $[L^2 T^{-2}]$ to $[L T^{-1}]$). Projection to 3D yields:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{A}}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} = -\frac{16\pi G}{c^2} \mathbf{J}_{\text{mass}} - \frac{4\pi}{c} \mathbf{J}_q,
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{J}_{\text{mass}} = \rho_{\text{body}} \mathbf{V}$ $[M L^{-2} T^{-1}]$ for DRAG (frame-dragging from mass currents), and $\mathbf{J}_q = \rho_q \mathbf{V}$ (electromagnetic current from helical twists in SWIRL, preliminary, with $\rho_q = \sum_i q_i \delta^3(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i)$). The $16\pi G/c^2$ coupling is the standard weak-field GEM normalization; the $4\pi/c$ term is the Gaussian EM source. DRAG acts as a rotation meter, and SWIRL provides a mechanism for EM-like effects through helical structure on the vortex.

\subsubsection{SHAKE and WAVE Components}

Both gravitational waves and photons emerge from the quintet modes: SHAKE represents the circulatory flow maintaining vortex stability and rest energy $E = m c^2$, while WAVE corresponds to oscillatory disturbances propagating at speed $c$, differing in their dimensional character (3D classical for gravitational waves, 4D-stabilized particle-like for photons). See tsunami principle (Section 2.5) for WAVE propagation versus bulk adjustments. The treatment separates SHAKE as the essential circulation preventing vortex collapse under aether pressure, quantified by circulation $\Gamma = n \kappa$ where $\kappa = 2 \pi \hbar / m$. WAVE uses the d'Alembertian for transverse perturbations from vortex oscillations:

\begin{equation}
\Box h_{\mu\nu} = -\frac{16\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{quad}} \quad (\text{for GW, classical 3D WAVE}),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\Box A^\mu = -\frac{4\pi}{c} J_q^\mu \quad (\text{for photons, 4D-stabilized WAVE}),
\end{equation}

where $\Box = \partial_t^2 / c^2 - \nabla^2$. Gravitational waves and photons differ in coupling and character: mass asymmetries for GW (SUCK perturbations, classical wave-like without quantization), charge for photons (SWIRL oscillations, particle-like packets). This predicts no observable ``gravitons'' as discrete particles, as GW spread classically in 3D without 4D confinement. The tsunami principle (Section 2.5) distinguishes bulk longitudinal adjustments ($v_L > c$, unobservable SUCK/SHAKE) from observable transverse WAVE at $c$, with WAVE as the surface ripple versus bulk SUCK rush. To derive these, consider the linearized GP for transverse perturbations on vortices: The Kelvin wave dispersion $\omega^2 = c^2 k^2 + \omega_0^2$ (with cutoff $\omega_0 \sim v_L / \xi_c$), projecting to the d'Alembertian form for far-field radiation. For GW, quadrupole sources arise from vortex motion asymmetries; for photons, current from helical oscillations (preliminary SWIRL). SHAKE unifies stability across gravity and EM as the energy to sustain deficits, while WAVE handles propagation. SymPy confirms the wave solutions and dispersion relations; code at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}.

In SHAKE, the circulatory mode acts as a photon-like excitation with energy $E = mc^2$, anchoring in 4D to counter collapse via resonance with the aether frequency $\sqrt{g \rho}$. This maintains vortex stability against pressure, with annihilation releasing $2mc^2$ as WAVE packets. Depletion ($\rho \to 0$) mismatches resonance, causing photon escape and instability.


\subsection{Electromagnetic Emergence from Helical Vortices}
\label{sec:EM-from-helical-vortices}

\subsubsection{Motivation and Physical Picture}
Endpoints (in 3D) of codimension-$2$ vortex \emph{sheet} world-volumes in $4$ spatial dimensions act as effective electric charges. Intuitively, ``aether'' flowing through the sheet into the compact extra direction sources an emergent gauge field in $(3{+}1)$D. Below we present a self-contained derivation showing how Maxwell's equations arise from the higher-form dual of the Gross--Pitaevskii (GP) phase in $4$D and a simple dimensional reduction.

\subsubsection{Setup and Notation}
We take spatial coordinates $x^i$ with $i=1,2,3,4$ and time $x^0\equiv t$. The GP field is $\psi=\sqrt{\rho}\,e^{i\theta}$ obeying
\begin{equation}
i\hbar\,\partial_t \psi=\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla_4^2+g|\psi|^2\right]\psi.
\end{equation}
Vortex \emph{sheets} are codimension-$2$ defects where $\theta$ is multi-valued. Throughout, capital indices $M,N,\ldots\in\{0,1,2,3,4\}$ denote $(4{+}1)$D spacetime, while Greek indices $\mu,\nu,\ldots\in\{0,1,2,3\}$ denote $(3{+}1)$D. We keep covariant notation for the emergent gauge sector; the underlying GP dynamics is nonrelativistic but only the topological (defect) content is required below.

\subsubsection{Topological Sheet Current}
The integer topology of sheet world-volumes is captured by the conserved $(4{+}1)$D 3-form current
\begin{equation}
J^{MNP} \;=\;\frac{1}{2\pi}\,\varepsilon^{MNPQR}\,\partial_Q\partial_R\theta,
\qquad \partial_M J^{MNP}=0,
\end{equation}
which is supported only on vortex world-volumes. Conservation follows from the antisymmetry of $\varepsilon^{MNPQR}$ and commutativity of partial derivatives away from the singular core.

\subsubsection{Dual Two-Form and Bulk Action in $(4{+}1)$D}
Dualize the GP phase to a Kalb--Ramond 2-form potential $B_{MN}$ with field strength
\begin{equation}
H_{MNP}=\partial_{[M}B_{NP]}.
\end{equation}
We take the bulk action (normalizations chosen for later convenience)
\begin{equation}
S_{5}=\int\! \mathrm d^{5}x\;\Big[\frac{1}{2g_B^2}\,H_{MNP}H^{MNP}\Big]\;+\;\int\!\mathrm d^{5}x\; B_{MN}\,J^{MN0}.
\label{eq:S5}
\end{equation}
Varying $B_{NP}$ gives the bulk equation of motion
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{g_B^2}\,\partial_M H^{MNP}+J^{NP0}=0,
\qquad \partial_{[M}H_{NPQ]}=0.
\end{equation}
The second identity is the Bianchi identity $H=\mathrm dB$.

\subsubsection{Dimensional Reduction and Identification of $A_\mu$}
Model the ``transition to 4D'' by compactifying $x^4$ with circumference $L_4$ and assuming fields are $x^4$-independent outside vortex cores. Decompose
\begin{equation}
B_{\mu\nu}\ \ \oplus\ \ B_{\mu 4}\equiv A_\mu,
\qquad
F_{\mu\nu}\equiv H_{\mu\nu 4}=\partial_\mu A_\nu-\partial_\nu A_\mu.
\end{equation}
Dropping the heavy $B_{\mu\nu}$ sector and integrating $x^4$ yields the $(3{+}1)$D action
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm EM}=\int\!\mathrm d^{4}x\;\left[\frac{L_4}{2g_B^2}\,F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}
+ A_\mu\, j_e^\mu\right],
\qquad
j_e^\mu \equiv \int_0^{L_4}\! \mathrm dx^4\;J^{\mu 4 0}.
\label{eq:SEM}
\end{equation}
That is, the effective electric current in $(3{+}1)$D is literally the flux of the sheet topological current into the compact direction.

\subsubsection{Euler--Lagrange Equations: Maxwell in $(3{+}1)$D}
Varying $A_\nu$ in \eqref{eq:SEM} gives, after an integration by parts,
\begin{equation}
\frac{L_4}{g_B^2}\,\partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu}+ j_e^\nu=0
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu}=\gamma\, j_e^\nu,\qquad
\gamma\equiv -\frac{g_B^2}{L_4}.
\label{eq:maxwell-gamma}
\end{equation}
(The overall sign of $\gamma$ depends on the sign convention chosen for the $A_\mu j^\mu$ term; only $|\gamma|$ is physically meaningful and we take $\gamma>0$ hereafter by absorbing the sign into $j_e$.) The Bianchi identity $\partial_{[\mu}F_{\nu\rho]}=0$ follows identically from $F=\mathrm dA$.

It is often convenient to define the \emph{physical} current
\begin{equation}
J^\nu \;\equiv\; \gamma\, j_e^\nu,
\end{equation}
so that Maxwell takes its canonical form
\begin{equation}
\partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu}=J^\nu,\qquad \partial_{[\mu}F_{\nu\rho]}=0.
\end{equation}
Current conservation $\partial_\nu J^\nu=0$ follows either from gauge invariance or from $\partial_M J^{MNP}=0$ in the parent theory.

\subsubsection{Charge Quantization from Sheet Topology}
Let $S^2$ be a small sphere in 3D linking a sheet endpoint (the ``particle''). Using the relation between $F$ and the $x^4$-component of $H$,
\begin{equation}
Q_{\rm phys}\;\equiv\;\int_{S^2}\! {}^\star F
\;=\;\frac{2\pi}{\gamma}\,n
\;\equiv\; q_0\, n,\qquad n\in\mathbb Z,\quad q_0\equiv\frac{2\pi}{\gamma}=\frac{2\pi L_4}{g_B^2}.
\label{eq:charge-quant}
\end{equation}
Thus the unit of charge is \emph{topological} (set by the twist number $n$) and independent of the vortex core size.

\subsubsection{Fields of a Static Endpoint}
For a static endpoint at the origin, the Maxwell solution outside the core is
\begin{equation}
\mathbf E(\mathbf r)=\frac{q_0\,n}{4\pi r^2}\,\hat{\mathbf r},\qquad \mathbf B=\mathbf 0,
\end{equation}
consistent with \eqref{eq:charge-quant}. Two endpoints with $\pm n$ form a dipole; moving/curved sheets source radiation.

\subsubsection{Helical Twist Boundary Condition Encodes $n$}
Impose a twist along the compact direction,
\begin{equation}
\theta(x^4+L_4)-\theta(x^4)=2\pi n,
\end{equation}
which implies $\int H_{\mu\nu 4}\,\mathrm dS^{\mu\nu}=2\pi n$ and hence the quantized $F_{\mu\nu}$ flux leading to \eqref{eq:charge-quant}.

\subsubsection{Consistency Checks}
\paragraph{Gauge invariance and current conservation.}
Gauge transformations $A_\mu\!\to\! A_\mu+\partial_\mu\alpha$ descend from $B\!\to\! B+\mathrm d\Lambda$ and imply $\partial_\nu J^\nu=0$.

\paragraph{Core-size independence.}
While the GP energy requires a short-distance cutoff near the sheet core, the emergent \emph{field} and the quantized flux $Q_{\rm phys}$ are independent of the core radius; only the integer $n$ matters.

\paragraph{Normalization to standard units.}
Defining $A_{\rm phys}\equiv A/e$ with $e^2\equiv g_B^2/(2L_4)$ gives the Heaviside--Lorentz form $S=-\int\!\frac14 F_{\rm phys}^2\,\mathrm d^4x+\int A_{\rm phys}\!\cdot\!J_{\rm phys}\,\mathrm d^4x$ with $J_{\rm phys}=e\,j_e$ and $F_{\rm phys}=\mathrm dA_{\rm phys}$. In these units the charge quantum is $Q_{\rm phys}=q_0 n$ with $q_0=2\pi/\gamma$ as in \eqref{eq:charge-quant}. Mapping to SI adds the usual $\varepsilon_0,\mu_0$ factors.

\subsubsection{Numerical Recipe (Preliminary)}
Evolve the GP field in $4$D with the twist boundary in $x^4$. From the phase,
\begin{equation}
J^{ij}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\,\varepsilon^{ijkl}\,\partial_k\partial_l\theta,\qquad
F_{ij}=\kappa\,J^{ij}\ (\kappa=L_4\ \text{up to normalization}),\qquad
F_{0i}\ \text{from the time-variation of the twist}.
\end{equation}
Outside cores you should recover $|\mathbf E|\propto n/r^2$; accelerating endpoints (or time-dependent twists) radiate.

\subsection{Resolution of the Preferred Frame Problem}

\subsubsection{The Classical Objection}

Classical aether theories violate special relativity by defining a preferred rest frame. We show our 4D medium avoids this through Machian dynamics---local frames emerge from balanced cosmic flows.

Historical aether theories posited a medium for wave propagation, which implied a preferred rest frame that would violate special relativity through effects like ether drag. In our mathematical framework, we explore whether such a structure can avoid this issue while preserving observed Lorentz invariance for measurable phenomena.

While stable configurations emerge from the energy functionals (Section 2.9), a potential issue is the implied preferred frame of the 4D medium; we resolve this through Machian principles derived from the postulates, showing that distributed vortices and dual wave modes eliminate a global rest frame.

\subsubsection{Machian Resolution}

The resolution emerges naturally from the model's postulates: With vortex sinks distributed throughout the universe (P-2), there is no global rest frame for the medium. Every point experiences flows toward nearby vortices, and a true ``rest'' would require a location equidistant from all matter---an impossibility in a matter-filled cosmos. Instead, local inertial frames arise where cosmic inflows balance, in a Machian sense: The aggregate drainage from distant vortices sets the reference for inertia and rotation.

This addresses the Michelson-Morley null result: Experimental setups co-move with the local flow pattern induced by Earth's vortex structure and surrounding matter. Observable signals propagate via Kelvin wave modes at the fixed speed $c$ (P-3), independent of the bulk longitudinal speed $v_L$. In essence, we are always ``surfing'' our local medium flow, with measurements respecting the emergent $c$ limit.

To add reference to how ``SUCK'' and ``SWIRL/DRAG'' transform properly under boosts: The irrotational SUCK flow (scalar potential $\Phi$) and solenoidal SWIRL/DRAG (vector potential $\mathbf{A}$) transform as components of a unified 4-potential under Lorentz boosts, ensuring invariance. The quintet transforms covariantly: SUCK/SHAKE as scalar components, SWIRL/DRAG as vector components of the 4-potential.

Clarify that $v_{\text{eff}}$ variation provides a natural cutoff, not a preferred frame: Local propagation speed $v_{\text{eff}} = \sqrt{g \rho_{4D}^{\text{local}} / m}$ varies with density, acting as a dynamical regulator that mimics relativistic effects without a fixed frame.

Connect to tsunami principle (bulk vs observable propagation): Bulk adjustments propagate at $v_L > c$ but are unobservable (tsunami bulk redistribution), while measurable disturbances (waves) are confined to $c$. See Section 2.5 for details on the tsunami analogy.

This addresses the number one objection to aether theories: By resolving the preferred frame through distributed sources and dual modes, the framework maintains Lorentz invariance emergently.

This resolution has been validated through numerical simulation (see supplementary materials):
\begin{itemize}
\item Distributed sink models show no global rest frame emerges
\item Complex balance patterns create local inertial frames
\item Quantitative predictions for $G$ anisotropy ($\sim 10^{-13} \,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) match observational bounds
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Explicit Lorentz Covariance}
Define the 4-potential with normalized time component and metric choice
$A^\mu=(\Phi/c,\,\mathbf A)$ and signature $(-,+,+,+)$. For a boost along $x$ with speed $v=\beta c$ (so $\gamma=(1-\beta^2)^{-1/2}$), the components transform as:
\begin{itemize}
\item $A^{0'} = \gamma\big(A^0 - \beta A^1\big)$
\item $A^{1'} = \gamma\big(A^1 - \beta A^0\big)$
\item $A^{2'} = A^2$, $A^{3'} = A^3$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{No superluminal signaling.} Observable interactions couple only to the gauge potentials $A_\mu$ on the WAVE surface, and the field equations are hyperbolic with characteristic speed $c$. The bulk flow at $v_L\gg c$ is nondynamical for local excitations and cannot be modulated to transmit information; therefore no signal can propagate faster than $c$.

\subsection{Electromagnetism in the WAVE sector}

\subsubsection{Global conservation and boundary flux}
Integrating the 4D continuity equation over a spatial domain and using the divergence theorem yields
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt}\int \rho_{4D}\, d^4r = -\sum_i \dot M_i \;-
\oint_{S_\infty} \rho_{4D}\, \mathbf v_4\cdot d\mathbf S\,.
\end{equation}
In steady state the boundary flux term balances the discrete sink strengths, representing flow into the bulk reservoir. We therefore keep this surface term explicitly rather than assuming it vanishes.

\paragraph{Derivation by symmetries.} Let $J^\mu$ be a conserved 4-current ($\partial_\mu J^\mu=0$) obtained by coarse-graining the defect dynamics. Introduce a 4-potential $A_\mu$ as a Lagrange multiplier enforcing current conservation via $S_{\rm int}=\int d^4x\, A_\mu J^\mu$. This implies the gauge redundancy $A_\mu\to A_\mu+\partial_\mu\lambda$. Demanding locality, linearity, Lorentz invariance in the WAVE sector, and gauge invariance, the unique quadratic kinetic term is $S_{\rm kin}=-(4\mu)^{-1}\int d^4x\, F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ with $F_{\mu\nu}=\partial_\mu A_\nu-\partial_\nu A_\mu$. Varying $A_\mu$ yields $\partial_\nu F^{\mu\nu} = (4\pi/c)\, J^\mu\ \text{(Gaussian)}\equiv \mu_0 J^\mu\ \text{(SI)}$, while $\partial_{[\alpha}F_{\beta\gamma]}=0$ gives the homogeneous equations. In $3{+}1$ form this reproduces Maxwell's equations with permittivity $\epsilon$ and permeability $\mu$ satisfying $c=1/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu}$.

\paragraph{Calibration.} In the static limit ($J^0=\rho_{\rm charge}$, $\mathbf J=0$) one recovers Coulomb's law and thereby fixes $\epsilon$ in terms of microparameters. For steady motion one obtains the Biot--Savart law; using the same projection kernel $K(w)$ of width $\xi_c$ as in the gravitational sector, the resulting prefactors naturally match the standard GEM normalization found in the GEM vector sector (details in the projection appendix).


The field equations (wave-like for $\Phi$ and $\mathbf{A}$) are Lorentz-covariant, as they resemble Maxwell's with mass currents (P-4 decomposition ensures irrotational/solenoidal split preserves under boosts). This derives from P-4 (Helmholtz) and P-3 (dual modes), where $v_{\text{eff}}$ variation mimics curved spacetime without breaking invariance. SymPy verifies the transformations; code at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}. DRAG as observable rotation preserves invariance; ties to black hole frame-dragging (Lense-Thirring effect in Kerr metrics, e.g., significant in Cygnus X-1 with spin $a \approx 0.95$).

\subsubsection{Undetectability of Medium Motion}

We co-move with local aether flow (Machian: aggregate drainage from cosmic vortices sets inertial frames). Detection would require measuring absolute velocity relative to a global rest frame, but distributed sources (P-2, P-6) mean no such frame---local $v_4$ balances to zero via inflows (like floating in a river). Michelson-Morley null: Interferometers measure Kelvin waves at fixed $c$ (P-3), not bulk $v_L$. Mathematically: Observable signals are WAVE modes (QNMs at $c$), bulk SUCK/SHAKE adjustments unobservable (tsunami principle, Section 2.5).

Mathematical differences from standard aether theories: Standard aether has fixed global rest frame, non-covariant equations. This framework has no global frame (distributed P-2 sinks), dual modes (P-3: bulk $v_L > c$ unobservable, signals at $c$), and discrete projections (P-6) smearing global effects. Covariant via 4-potential transform, unlike non-relativistic aether. Key: $v_{\text{eff}}$ varies dynamically, mimicking GR without preferred direction.

To demonstrate causality rigorously, consider the 4D wave equation for a scalar perturbation $\varphi$:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t^2 \varphi - v_L^2 \nabla_4^2 \varphi = S(\mathbf{r}_4, t).
\end{equation}

The retarded Green's function in 4D is expressed using the principal value distribution to handle singularities:

\begin{equation}
G_4(t, r_4) = \frac{1}{4 \pi^2 v_L} \, \text{pf} \left[ (v_L^2 t^2 - r_4^2)^{-3/2} \theta(v_L^2 t^2 - r_4^2) \right] \theta(t),
\end{equation}

where $r_4 = \sqrt{r^2 + w^2}$, pf denotes the principal value, and the normalization ensures dimensional consistency $[T L^{-4}]$. This form incorporates the light-cone singularity in a well-defined distributional sense, with support on and inside the cone $t \geq r_4 / v_L$. The 4D retarded Green's function (see Appendix A for derivation) preserves causality while allowing bulk adjustments. This preserves causality for ``WAVE'' modes at $c$, while bulk ``SUCK'' adjusts unobservably.

The projected propagator on the $w=0$ slice is now discrete, summing contributions from vortex intersections rather than integrating over $w$:

\begin{equation}
G_{\text{proj}}(t, r) = \sum_i G_4(t, \sqrt{r^2 + w_i^2}),
\end{equation}

where $w_i$ are discrete offsets for each vortex $i$ (e.g., small for charged particles, larger for neutrinos). The projected propagation preserves bulk support for $t \geq r / v_L$, potentially $>c$. However, observable signals---such as gravitational waves or light---are Kelvin wave modes fixed at $c$. Longitudinal bulk modes adjust steady-state configurations mathematically but do not carry information to 3D observers, as vortex particles couple primarily to Kelvin modes. The healing length $\xi_c$ regularizes the core, smearing the projected fronts over $\Delta t \sim \xi_c^2 / (2 r v_L)$, effectively limiting to $c$. Symbolic summation confirms the projected lightcone support is confined to $t \geq r / c$ for Kelvin components.

The background density $\rho_0$ sources a quadratic potential $\Phi \supset 2\pi G \rho_0 r^2$, but global inflows yield $\Phi_{\text{global}} \approx 2\pi G \langle \rho \rangle r^2$, canceling if $\langle \rho_{\text{cosmo}} \rangle = \rho_0$. Residual asymmetry predicts $G$ anisotropy $\sim 10^{-13} \,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, consistent with bounds. Twists from emergent electromagnetism (universal orientation in $y$-$w$ plane) do not break this resolution, as they align with the projected geometry without introducing a preferred direction.

\subsubsection{The Apparent Paradox Resolution}

How can gravitational effects seem ``instantaneous'' for orbits while gravitational waves travel at $c$?

\textbf{Answer}: They're different phenomena!
\begin{itemize}
\item Orbital mechanics depends on the steady flow pattern $\Phi$
\item This pattern adjusts through the bulk at $v_L \gg c$
\item But we move with the flow (equivalence principle)
\item Only changes in the pattern (waves) are observable at $c$
\end{itemize}
Orbital mechanics depends on steady ``SUCK'' flow... Changes (``WAVE'' waves) observable at $c$. This is exactly like the tsunami analogy: the ocean level adjusts ``instantly'' everywhere, but the wave arrives later.

\subsubsection{Causality Check}

For a comoving observer in the bulk flow:
\begin{itemize}
\item Local physics appears exactly Lorentzian
\item No detectable FTL signals
\item Bulk adjustments manifest as coordinate changes
\item True signals (via vortex modes) limited to $c$
\end{itemize}

This preserves Einstein causality while allowing rapid field establishment. $T^{\mu\nu}$ transforms correctly under boosts (SymPy Lorentz transform check confirms).

\subsubsection{Implications}

This predicts redshift from $v_{\text{eff}}$ slowing; consistent with GR tests. Near masses, $v_{\text{eff}} \approx c \left(1 - \frac{G M}{2 c^2 r}\right)$ (from $\delta \rho_{4D} / \rho_{4D}^0 \approx - G M / (c^2 r)$).

This ties to the quintet: SUCK for bulk drainage setup (gravitational field), SWIRL for helical stability (electromagnetic fields), DRAG for rotational indicators, SHAKE for vortex maintenance, and WAVE for observable energy transfer (GW/photons).

\subsection{The Tsunami Principle}

To understand how our framework reconciles the speed of gravity with observational constraints, consider ocean tsunami waves triggered by an underwater tectonic shift opening a cavity. The immediate inward rush of water to fill the void represents the bulk flow (unobservable adjustments at $v_L > c$), while the propagating surface disturbance is the observable wave (at finite speed $c$). Similarly, in our aether:
\begin{itemize}
\item Longitudinal density adjustments propagate at $v_L \gg c$ through the 4D bulk
\item Observable effects in the 3D slice propagate at $c = \sqrt{T / \sigma}$
\item Matter (vortices) responds to local flow, not bulk adjustments
\end{itemize}

This dual propagation ensures:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Orbital mechanics remain stable (bulk adjusts quickly)
\item Causality is preserved (signals limited to $c$)
\item Both requirements are satisfied without paradox
\end{enumerate}

We call bulk density adjustments propagating at $v_L > c$ ``tsunamis''---they establish fields rapidly but remain unobservable, like ocean depth changes vs surface waves.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Why Two Speeds Without Membranes]
Early versions required explicit 3D membranes, but our discrete projection (P-6) eliminates this: Vortex intersections create effective ``surface tension'' dynamically, with Kelvin waves as natural observables. The 4D bulk provides the medium for fast adjustments without artificial structures.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Mathematical Demonstration}

\textbf{Key Idea: Bulk vs. observable responses in the same medium.}

Consider a mass $M$ that suddenly appears at the origin. In our framework:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bulk Response} (Gravitational Field): The density perturbation satisfies:
\begin{equation}
\partial_t^2 \delta\rho - v_L^2 \nabla_4^2 \delta\rho = -M\delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4)\delta(t)
\end{equation}
This ``SUCK'' spreads rapidly but unobservably. The solution spreads at speed $v_L$ through the 4D bulk. For the steady-state gravitational potential:
\begin{equation}
\Phi(\mathbf{r},t) \approx -\frac{GM}{r} \theta(t - r/v_L)
\end{equation}
But we don't directly observe this---we move with the flow!

\item \textbf{Observable Response} (Gravitational Waves): Vortex oscillations propagate via:
\begin{equation}
\Box h_{\mu\nu} = -\frac{16\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
These travel at speed $c$ and are directly detectable.
\end{itemize}

Here $\nabla_4^2 \equiv \partial^2/\partial x^2 + \partial^2/\partial y^2 + \partial^2/\partial z^2 + \partial^2/\partial w^2$ acts on all four spatial coordinates.

The 4D Laplacian $\nabla_4^2 = \partial^2/\partial x^2 + \partial^2/\partial y^2 + \partial^2/\partial z^2 + \partial^2/\partial w^2$ acts on all four spatial coordinates.

SymPy confirms wave equation structure and Heaviside solution form; code at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}.\footnote{Dimensions for bulk equation: LHS $[\delta\rho] / T^2 \sim M L^{-4} T^{-2}$, RHS source $M \delta^4 \delta(t) \sim M L^{-4} T^{-1}$ (impulse; consistent with rate interpretation).}

\subsubsection{Resolution of the Apparent Paradox}

\textbf{Key Idea: Different phenomena resolve speed paradox.}

How can gravitational effects seem ``instantaneous'' for orbits while gravitational waves travel at $c$?

\textbf{Answer}: They're different phenomena!
\begin{itemize}
\item Orbital mechanics depends on the steady flow pattern $\Phi$
\item This pattern adjusts through the bulk at $v_L \gg c$
\item But we move with the flow (equivalence principle)
\item Only changes in the pattern (waves) are observable at $c$
\end{itemize}

Orbital mechanics depends on steady ``SUCK'' flow... Changes (``WAVE'' waves) observable at $c$. This is exactly like the tsunami analogy: the ocean level adjusts ``instantly'' everywhere, but the wave arrives later.

\subsubsection{Causality Check}

\textbf{Key Idea: Local Lorentzian physics preserved.}

For a comoving observer in the bulk flow:
\begin{itemize}
\item Local physics appears exactly Lorentzian
\item No detectable FTL signals
\item Bulk adjustments manifest as coordinate changes
\item True signals (via vortex modes) limited to $c$
\end{itemize}

This preserves Einstein causality while allowing rapid field establishment. $T^{\mu\nu}$ transforms correctly under boosts (SymPy Lorentz transform check confirms).

\subsubsection{Implications}

\textbf{Key Idea: Predictions from dual modes.}

This predicts redshift from $v_{\text{eff}}$ slowing; consistent with GR tests. Near masses, $v_{\text{eff}} \approx c \left(1 - \frac{G M}{2 c^2 r}\right)$ (from $\delta \rho_{4D} / \rho_{4D}^0 \approx - G M / (c^2 r)$).

Like Kerr BH event horizons: Bulk adjustments unobservable, waves detectable.

\subsubsection{Quintet Tie-In}

This ties to the quintet: SUCK for bulk drainage setup (gravitational field), SHAKE for helical stability (rest energy), SWIRL for electromagnetic fields (preliminary), DRAG for rotational observables, and WAVE for Kelvin waves for GW/photons (observable energy transfer).

\subsection{Conservation Laws and Aether Drainage}

The 4D compressible medium (P-1) ensures global conservation laws hold despite local drainage from vortex sinks (P-2), as flux redirects into the extra dimension without loss. This resolves apparent non-conservation in 3D projections (Section 2.7) while maintaining consistency with dual wave modes (P-3) and quantized topology (P-5). The framework derives these laws from the Gross-Pitaevskii structure (P-1), incorporating boundary conditions for vortex sheets. We shift to discrete projections, aggregating over finite vortex intersections rather than continuous integrals over $w$. This simplifies boundary handling while preserving the original global principles. The quintet integrates naturally: SUCK (drainage) appears as apparent mass removal in 3D but is conserved in 4D via bulk redirection; SWIRL (helicity) preserves topological invariants like charge through phase windings; DRAG conserves angular momentum; SHAKE (circulation) preserves energy by maintaining vortex stability; WAVE (Kelvin waves) conserves energy by converting to bulk modes or observable radiation (e.g., photons as vortex oscillations).

Drainage $\equiv$ net flux $\Phi = \int \rho \mathbf{v} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} \, dA$ through hypersurface at $w = \text{const}$. Drainage creates ``SUCK'' but doesn't deplete the medium, as it draws from the infinite 4D reservoir.

\subsubsection{Global Conservation}
Although the sinks introduce effective inhomogeneities in the 3D equations, the full 4D continuity ensures no net loss. To derive this explicitly, integrate the 4D continuity equation from the postulates (P-1 and P-2) over all 4D space:

\begin{equation}
\int d^4 r \left[ \partial_t \rho_{4D} + \nabla_4 \cdot (\rho_{4D} \mathbf{v}_4) \right] = \int d^4 r \left[ -\sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}) \right].
\end{equation}

The divergence term integrates to a surface integral at infinity, which vanishes by the boundary conditions ($\mathbf{v}_4 \to 0$ as $|\mathbf{r}_4| \to \infty$), yielding

\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt} \int \rho_{4D} \, d^4 r = -\sum_i \dot{M}_i,
\end{equation}

where the drained ``mass'' is redirected into the infinite bulk along the extra dimension $w \to \pm \infty$, acting as a reservoir without back-reaction on the $w=0$ slice. This ensures ``SUCK'' flux conservation in 4D despite 3D deficits. In the discrete 3D projection (P-6), we aggregate over vortex intersections without an averaging operator, directly defining projected quantities as sums. This yields the effective 3D continuity:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \rho_{3D} + \nabla \cdot (\rho_{3D} \mathbf{v}) = -\sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^3(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i).
\end{equation}

Similar projections apply to the Euler equation, producing effective 3D dynamics with sink sources that appear as apparent mass removal while preserving global conservation in 4D (detailed in bulk dissipation below). Physically, this is like discrete underwater drains vanishing water from the surface view, thinning the medium and inducing inflows that mimic attraction. Like a waterfall that never empties the river above, the drainage draws from the infinite 4D structure (infinite reservoir), with re-emergence from bulk modes maintaining balance.

By Noether's theorem, continuous symmetries yield conservation laws. Our 4D translations preserve total mass-energy despite local drainage. The framework connects to particle creation/annihilation symmetry: Creation corresponds to vortex-antivortex pair formation (conserving net drainage, as antivortices act as sources balancing sinks), while annihilation releases WAVE energy into bulk modes or radiation, preserving total energy in 4D. Quintet conservation includes: SWIRL topology preserves charge; DRAG angular momentum; SHAKE energy; WAVE radiation.

\subsubsection{Microscopic Drainage Mechanism}
At the vortex cores, drainage occurs through phase singularities in the order parameter $\Psi=0$ over the healing length $\xi_c$. The phase winds by $2\pi n$, creating a flux into the extra dimension. To approximate this, near the core, the drainage velocity is

\begin{equation}
v_w \approx \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi r_4},
\end{equation}

where $r_4 = \sqrt{\rho^2 + w^2}$ and $\Gamma$ is the circulation, with far-field decay $v_w \sim 1/|w|$. The total sink strength for each vortex is obtained by aggregating the flux over the effective core area $\sim \pi \xi_c^2$ in the perpendicular plane:

\begin{equation}
\dot{M}_i = \rho_{4D}^0 \sum v_w \, dA_w \approx \rho_{4D}^0 \Gamma \xi_c^2,
\end{equation}

where the sum approximates the core cross-section times average velocity (SymPy integrations confirm the flux approximation, yielding exact factors independent of cutoff). Here, $\Gamma = n \kappa$ with $\kappa = 2 \pi \hbar / m$ (from GP phase quantization in P-1). Reconnections act as ``valves,'' releasing flux into bulk modes, with energy barriers

\begin{equation}
\Delta E \approx \rho_{4D}^0 \Gamma^2 \xi_c^2 \ln(L / \xi_c) / (4\pi)
\end{equation}

preventing uncontrolled leakage.

With helical twists (Section 2.3), drainage couples to charge: Twisted vortices have enhanced $\dot{M}_i \propto \tau \Gamma$ (twist density $\tau$), but conservation holds as twists preserve topology during reconnections. Helical SWIRL couples to charge, conserved in reconnections. WAVE vibrations (Kelvin waves) modulate the core, adding a small oscillatory term to $v_w$ ($\delta v_w \sim \omega \delta R$), but average flux unchanged, with energy conserved via radiation.

\subsubsection{Bulk Dissipation}
To prevent accumulation and back-reaction, the bulk continuity includes a dissipation term converting flux to non-interacting excitations:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \rho_{\text{bulk}} + \partial_w (\rho_{\text{bulk}} v_w) = -\gamma \rho_{\text{bulk}},
\end{equation}

with rate $\gamma \sim v_L / L_{\text{univ}}$, where $L_{\text{univ}}$ is the universe scale (e.g., Hubble length), setting the dissipation horizon where flux converts to non-interacting modes. The drainage geometry motivates directional flow: $v_w = \text{sign}(w) \cdot v$ where $v > 0$ is the outflow magnitude, reflecting symmetric outward flux from the central $w=0$ slice (sinks as bidirectional drains, per P-2). The scale $v \sim v_L$ emerges from bulk longitudinal modes at $v_L = \sqrt{g \rho_{4D}^0 / m}$ (governing rapid adjustments in the compressible medium, P-1), while observables remain confined to Kelvin wave modes at $c$.

\textbf{Key Idea:} Symmetric outward drainage with dissipation.

We solve piecewise for $w > 0$ and $w < 0$, assuming steady state ($\partial_t \rho_{\text{bulk}} = 0$) for the spatial part to capture long-term equilibrium (no ongoing accumulation), while retaining transient time dependence $e^{-\gamma t}$ as a multiplier for initial perturbations decaying over short timescales.

\begin{itemize}
\item For $w > 0$: $v_w = +v$, so $v \partial_w \rho_{\text{bulk}} = -\gamma \rho_{\text{bulk}}$ yields $\partial_w \rho_{\text{bulk}} = -(\gamma / v) \rho_{\text{bulk}}$. Solution: $\rho_{\text{bulk}}(w) = \rho(0^+) e^{-w / \lambda}$ with $\lambda = v / \gamma$.
\item For $w < 0$: $v_w = -v$, so $-v \partial_w \rho_{\text{bulk}} = -\gamma \rho_{\text{bulk}}$ yields $\partial_w \rho_{\text{bulk}} = (\gamma / v) \rho_{\text{bulk}}$. Solution: $\rho_{\text{bulk}}(w) = \rho(0^-) e^{w / \lambda} = \rho(0^-) e^{-|w| / \lambda}$ (since $w < 0$).
\end{itemize}

Assuming symmetry ($\rho(0^+) = \rho(0^-) = \rho_{\text{inj}}$, injected from sinks), the overall form is

\begin{equation}
\rho_{\text{bulk}}(w) = \rho_{\text{inj}} \, e^{-\gamma t} \, e^{-|w| / \lambda},
\end{equation}

where the $e^{-\gamma t}$ term accounts for transient decay of initial conditions (optional for pure steady-state analysis, set to 1 if $\partial_t = 0$ globally). This satisfies the equation for $w \neq 0$ (SymPy-solved: substitute into ODE confirms exact).

At $w=0$, differentiating $\partial_w (\rho_{\text{bulk}} v_w)$ globally introduces a delta function:

\begin{equation}
\partial_w [\text{sign}(w) v \rho_{\text{bulk}}] = \text{sign}(w) v \partial_w \rho_{\text{bulk}} + 2 v \rho_{\text{bulk}} \delta(w)    
\end{equation}

The first term equals $-\gamma \rho_{\text{bulk}}$ (from piecewise), while $+2 v \rho_{\text{inj}} \delta(w)$ represents the positive source injection at $w=0$ (flux from P-2 vortex sinks), balancing the equation without additional terms. Physically, this delta encodes the topological discontinuity from drainage, ensuring energy conversion to bulk modes without back-reaction on the $w=0$ slice.

This ensures constant background $\rho_{4D}^0$ and $\dot{G} = 0$, consistent with bounds $|\dot{G}/G| \lesssim 10^{-13} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. WAVE energy (Kelvin waves) dissipates similarly, converting to bulk modes or photons, preserving total energy in 4D. Twists preserve topology (P-5), conserving charge.

Analogously, this dissipation mimics energy conversion to heat in a vast reservoir, maintaining equilibrium. For twisted vortices (EM context), dissipation preserves charge topology, as windings are conserved invariants.

\subsubsection{Machian Balance}
The uniform background $\rho_0$ sources a quadratic potential term. From the scalar Poisson equation (derived in the updated scalar sector) $\nabla^2 \Phi = -4\pi G \rho_0$ (where the background density acts as an effective negative source for consistency with deficits, creating a repulsive-like effect in the potential),

\begin{equation}
\Phi \supset -\frac{2\pi G \rho_0}{3} r^2,
\end{equation}

implying acceleration

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{a} = -\nabla \Phi = \frac{4\pi G \rho_0}{3} \mathbf{r}
\end{equation}

(corrected for units $[\Phi] = [L^2 T^{-2}]$, as verified from field equations and SymPy symbolic checks; code at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}; outward direction for background push, balancing the inward SUCK from deficits). Global inflows from cosmic matter (discrete vortices as flow patterns) provide a counter-term:

\begin{equation}
\Phi_{\text{global}} \approx \frac{2\pi G \langle \rho \rangle}{3} r^2,
\end{equation}

cancelling if $\langle \rho_{\text{cosmo}} \rangle = \rho_0$ (aggregate deficits from vortex flows balancing background). Residual asymmetry predicts $G$ anisotropy $\sim 10^{-13} \,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, a testable pattern consistent with observational bounds.

Twists in SWIRL add no net background (neutral on average), preserving the balance. WAVE vibrations (Kelvin waves) contribute a small positive energy density to $\langle \rho \rangle$ (as $\rho_{\text{vib}} / c^2$), but this is microscopic and averages out cosmologically, maintaining the equilibrium. The tsunami principle reinforces this: bulk flows are unfelt locally (we move with them), while observable changes propagate at $c$.

\subsection{4D to 3D Projection Mechanism}

Building on the field equations derived in the previous subsection, we now detail the projection mechanism that maps the 4D mathematical structure to effective 3D dynamics. In this approach, we shift from continuous integration over the extra dimension $w$ to discrete summing over vortex sheet intersections with the $w=0$ hypersurface. This transforms vortex sheets in 4D (codimension-2 defects from P-5) into point-like sources in 3D while \emph{preserving} loop circulation on the slice (projection invariance). The process relies on the compressible medium (P-1) with sinks (P-2) draining into the extra dimension, while dual wave modes (P-3) ensure observable propagation at $c$ despite bulk speeds $v_L > c$. We begin with the continuity projection to illustrate effective sources, then derive the half-space split for circulation. Discrete projection follows P-6, aggregating over finite vortex counts without the averaging operator, directly defining projected quantities as sums. This yields particles as discrete flow patterns, with SWIRL (helical structure) and DRAG (circulation) appearing on the slice through the solenoidal sector.

To derive the projection explicitly, start with the 4D continuity equation from the postulates (P-1 and P-2):

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \rho_{4D} + \nabla_4 \cdot (\rho_{4D} \mathbf{v}_4) = -\sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}),
\end{equation}

where $\rho_{4D}$ is the 4D density $[M L^{-4}]$, $\mathbf{v}_4$ the 4-velocity, and $\dot{M}_i = \rho_{4D}^0 \Gamma_i \xi_c^2$ the sink strength (P-2), with the delta supported on the vortex sheet. Dimensions: LHS $[\partial_t \rho_{4D}] = [M L^{-4} T^{-1}]$, $[\nabla_4 \cdot (\rho_{4D} \mathbf{v}_4)] = [M L^{-4} T^{-1}]$, RHS $[\dot{M}_i \delta^4] = [M T^{-1}] [L^{-4}] = [M L^{-4} T^{-1}]$, consistent.

To illustrate the projection, consider a simple example: a vortex sheet in 4D as a \emph{tilted disk}. In the $w=0$ slice this appears as an elliptical intersection. For topological defects, the slice circulation measured by any small loop linking the intersection once equals the sheet strength $\Gamma$ (thin/flat limit). The contribution splits cleanly into two \emph{half-spaces} across the slice, each providing $\Gamma/2$. Potential (“drainage”) adjustments on the slice are gradient fields and contribute \emph{zero} to loop circulation. The tilted-disk picture is then a geometric aid for visualizing the two half-space contributions without implying any multiplicative enhancement. Topological invariants are preserved, and SWIRL/DRAG observables arise from the solenoidal part of the projected flow.

The effective 3D density is defined via discrete projection as
\begin{equation}
\rho_{3D}(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_0 - \sum_i m_i \delta^3(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i),
\end{equation}
where $\rho_0 = \rho_{4D}^0 \xi_c$ is the projected background density (P-1, P-3), and $m_i$ is the deficit mass associated with vortex $i$, with $\mathbf{r}_i$ its intersection point. This form captures the apparent matter density $\rho_{\text{body}} = \sum_i m_i \delta^3(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i)$ as aggregated deficits, sourcing the field equations (Section 2.2). Dimensions: $\rho_{3D} [M L^{-3}] = [M L^{-4}] [L]$, consistent. This projects 4D sheets to 3D points, representing particles as discrete flow patterns.

For the velocity field on the slice, the correctly normalized 4D$\!\to$3D kernel yields the standard azimuthal profile. In an axially symmetric neighborhood of radius $\rho$ around the intersection,
\begin{equation}
v_\theta(\rho)
= \frac{\Gamma}{4\pi\rho} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\rho^2\,dw}{(\rho^2 + w^2)^{3/2}}
= \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi\rho}.
\end{equation}
The integral identities
\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\rho^2\,dw}{(\rho^2 + w^2)^{3/2}}=2, 
\qquad
\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\rho^2\,dw}{(\rho^2 + w^2)^{3/2}}=1
\]
make the \emph{half-space split} explicit: each side of the slice contributes $\Gamma/2$ to the loop circulation, so that
\[
\oint_{\gamma}\mathbf v\cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \;=\; \frac{\Gamma}{2} \;+\; \frac{\Gamma}{2} \;=\; \Gamma,
\]
consistent with projection invariance. The $w$-directed drainage flow is potential on the slice and therefore does not contribute to this loop integral.

Finally, we note that standard weak-field couplings (e.g., $16\pi G/c^2$ in GEM form) enter from their usual linearized normalizations; no additional geometric multipliers are implied by the projection. The mechanism above suffices to relate 4D vortex sheets to 3D sources and circulations without invoking any multiplicative enhancement.

\subsection{Calibration of Physical Constants}

Having established the projection mechanism and its \emph{projection-invariant} slice circulation, we now calibrate the mathematical framework to align with empirical observations, demonstrating its parsimony. The model requires only three calibrated parameters---Newton's gravitational constant $G$, the speed of light $c$, and the background density $\rho_0$---while all other quantities emerge directly from the foundational postulates (P-1 to P-6) without additional adjustments. The framework derives relations from 4D axioms, rescales via discrete projection (Section 2.7), and calibrates minimally to $G$/$c$/$\rho_0$ for alignment with observations. This is predictive rather than fitted: the standard weak-field gravitoelectromagnetic (GEM) couplings (e.g., $16\pi G/c^2$) enter with their usual linearized normalization. Dimension shifts for the potentials (to $[L^2 T^{-2}]$ for $\Phi$ and $[L T^{-1}]$ for $\mathbf{A}$) align with observed physics via $G$ and $c$ without extra factors.

The primary calibration arises in the scalar sector (SUCK), where the gravitational constant $G$ emerges from the far-field limit of the scalar field equation (derived in Section 2.2):

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{v_{\text{eff}}^2} \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G \rho_{\text{body}}.
\end{equation}

In the static limit, this reduces to the Newtonian Poisson equation, $\nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G \rho_{\text{body}}$, where $\rho_{\text{body}}$ is the effective matter density from aggregated vortex deficits. The coefficient $4\pi G$ is fixed by matching to the Newtonian limit, with $\rho_0 = \rho_{4D}^0 \xi_c$ (projected 3D background density, with $\xi_c$ the microscopic core scale). Linearizing the 4D continuity around $\rho_{4D} = \rho_{4D}^0 + \delta \rho_{4D}$ and projecting yields the source term. The overall calibration is captured by
\begin{equation}
G = \frac{c^2}{4\pi \bar{n} \bar{m} \xi_c^2},
\end{equation}
where $\bar{n}$ is the vortex density (number per unit volume, e.g., from cosmology), $\bar{m}$ is the average deficit mass per vortex (microscopic), and $\xi_c=\hbar/\sqrt{2 m g \rho_{4D}^0}$ follows from P-1. This locks the scale so that post-Newtonian corrections emerge without further tuning.

In the vector sector (SWIRL/DRAG), the field equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{A}}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} = -\frac{16\pi G}{c^2} \mathbf{J}_{\text{mass}} - \frac{4\pi}{c} \mathbf{J}_q,
\end{equation}
uses the \emph{standard} weak-field GEM normalization for the mass-current coupling ($16\pi G/c^2$) and the Gaussian EM source ($4\pi/c$). Projection invariance implies no additional geometric multipliers: drainage/potential components are gradient fields on the slice and contribute zero to loop circulation, while the solenoidal sector carries the observed circulation.

The parameters are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:parameters}, distinguishing those calibrated ($G$, $c$, $\rho_0$) from those derived. The postulates contribute as follows: P-1 (GP dynamics) provides $\xi_c$ and $v_L = \sqrt{g \rho_{4D}^0 / m}$; P-3 defines dual wave modes ($v_L$, $c$, $v_{\text{eff}}$); P-5 fixes quantized circulation $\Gamma = n \kappa$ and \emph{projection-invariant} slice circulation; and $\rho_0$ follows from projection. When hierarchical energetics that lead to the golden ratio are relevant, we reference Norris (2025) \cite{Norris2025GoldenRatio} without using it here for calibration.

This minimal calibration---$G$, $c$, and $\rho_0$ fixing gravity and the vector-sector normalization—produces rich dynamics, such as perihelion advance or frame-dragging, without additional parameters. The geometric and topological origins (projection invariance and quantized circulation) highlight why this framework reproduces observed patterns efficiently, inviting further tests in astrophysical settings.

\subsubsection{Parameter Independence Verification}

Our three scales are mathematically independent:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\xi_c$: Set by quantum/classical boundary ($\hbar$, $m$, $g$, $\rho_{4D}^0$)
\item $\lambda_{\text{cosmo}}$: Set by matter distribution (observational)
\item $c$: Emergent from vortex dynamics (not derived from $\xi_c$ or $\lambda_{\text{cosmo}}$)
\end{itemize}

No combination of $\xi_c$ and $\lambda_{\text{cosmo}}$ yields $c$, preventing overconstraint. The tsunami principle allows $v_L \gg c$ for bulk adjustments (SUCK/SHAKE) while keeping observables at $c$ in the transverse WAVE sector.

\subsection{Energy Considerations and Stability}

To understand the persistence of certain vortex configurations within this mathematical framework, we explore energy functionals derived from the Gross-Pitaevskii-like structure introduced in the postulates. These functionals identify stable and unstable states, where minima correspond to persistent patterns and saddles to transient ones. We also derive a timescale hierarchy that justifies treating vortex cores as quasi-steady on macroscopic scales. Additionally, we establish the topological protection for braided vortex stability, ensuring resonance-free, scale-invariant structures. These features tie to postulates P-1 (Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics), P-2 (vortex sinks), P-3 (dual wave modes), and P-5 (quantized vortices with topological constraints), providing insight into why certain structures endure and how they encode geometric patterns predictive of physical phenomena. With the hybrid approach, we enhance the functionals to include contributions from phase twists, tying to emergent charge properties, and incorporate discrete vortex projections for particle-like stability.

The foundational energy functional for the order parameter $\Psi$ (with $|\Psi|^2 = \rho_{4D}/m$) is given by
\begin{equation}
E[\Psi] = \int d^4 r \left[ \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} |\nabla_4 \Psi|^2 + \frac{g m}{2} |\Psi|^4 \right],
\end{equation}
where the first term captures kinetic (gradient) energy from quantum dispersion, and the second represents nonlinear interactions balancing self-focusing. Kinetic term includes contributions from SUCK, SWIRL/DRAG, and SHAKE/WAVE. This derives from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation $i \hbar \partial_t \Psi = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \nabla_4^2 \Psi + g m |\Psi|^2 \Psi$ via the Madelung transform ($\Psi = \sqrt{\rho_{4D}/m} e^{i \theta}$), yielding hydrodynamic equations with quantum pressure $\nabla_4 \left( \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\nabla_4^2 \sqrt{\rho_{4D}/m}}{\sqrt{\rho_{4D}/m}} \right)$. This aligns with the quintet: the kinetic term includes contributions from SUCK (deficits), SWIRL/DRAG (helical phases and rotation), and SHAKE/WAVE (vortex oscillations and perturbations).

To incorporate emergent electromagnetism from SWIRL (stability via phase twists $\theta = \atan2(y, x) + \tau w$), add a twist energy term:
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{twist}} = \int d^4 r \, \frac{\hbar^2 \tau^2}{2m} \, |\Psi|^2,
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is a (quantized) twist density along the extra dimension set by boundary conditions and energy minimization on the sheet. This adds cost for charged vortices via SWIRL. The term arises from the kinetic energy of axial phase gradients, increasing the total $E$ for charged (twisted) vortices compared to neutral (untwisted) ones, providing a natural mass splitting for neutral vs.\ charged counterparts.

For SHAKE (vortex-maintaining circulation) and WAVE (perturbations), extend the functional with a term reflecting the energy of Kelvin wave modes:
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{shake}} = \int d^4 r \, \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega \, \rho_{4D} / m,
\end{equation}
where $\omega \sim v_L / \xi_c$ is the characteristic Kelvin wave frequency, integrated over the core volume $\sim \xi_c^4$. This represents zero-point energy for SHAKE stability, with WAVE handling propagation. A crude estimate gives $E_{\text{shake}} \approx (\frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega) \rho_0 \xi_c^3 / m$ (with $\rho_0 = \rho_{4D}^0 \xi_c$), tying to the minimum energy needed to sustain the deficit, where $m \approx \rho_0 \xi_c^3$ (core deficit mass).

To assess dynamical stability, consider the core healing length $\xi_c$ (core regularization scale) and bulk speed $v_L$. The healing length balances quantum pressure against interaction in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation near the core ($\rho_{4D} \to 0$ over the healing length $\xi_c$): setting the gradient scale $\sim 1/\xi_c$ and equating terms gives
\begin{equation}
\xi_c = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2 m g \rho_{4D}^0}},
\end{equation}
while the bulk sound speed derives from linearizing the equation of state $P = (g/2) \rho_{4D}^2 / m$ as $\partial P / \partial \rho_{4D} = g \rho_{4D}^0 / m$, yielding
\begin{equation}
v_L = \sqrt{\frac{g \rho_{4D}^0}{m}}.
\end{equation}

The core relaxation timescale is then
\begin{equation}
\tau_{\text{core}} = \frac{\xi_c}{v_L} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2 g \rho_{4D}^0}},
\end{equation}
which is extremely small compared to macroscopic timescales (e.g., wave propagation $\tau_{\text{prop}} \approx r / v_{\text{eff}}$ or orbital periods), yielding a hierarchy $\tau_{\text{core}} \ll \tau_{\text{macro}}$. Thus, cores rapidly equilibrate internally via quantum/sound waves, appearing steady while sourcing time-dependent fields globally.

With discrete projections, the energy functionals apply per vortex, aggregated over the density $\bar{n}$. This allows for particle-like interpretations: vortices represent fundamental entities, with leptons as closed toroidal loops (stable due to conserved winding), quarks as braided open ends (requiring confinement via tension), and dark matter as untwisted vortices (no charge, gravitational only). The twist energy $E_{\text{twist}}$ makes charged particles heavier, providing a natural splitting, while $E_{\text{shake}}$ sources rest energy.

\medskip
\noindent\textit{Topological stability.}
In braided vortex arrangements---where codimension-2 defects (P-5) entangle phase windings in the compressible 4D medium (P-1)---stability against reconnection is a topological property. Avoidance of low-order resonances among nested loops improves stability; hierarchical energetics and precise twist/spacing criteria can be developed from the same functional (details outside the present manuscript). Where needed later, quantitative hierarchical results are referenced externally \cite{Norris2025GoldenRatio} without being used here.

Composites benefit from helical combinations in SWIRL for emergent EM properties: multiple helices can merge/interfere according to topological rules (e.g., three quarks with $2\pi/3$ phase separation summing to a full $2\pi$ closure for unit charge), while DRAG and WAVE control rotational coupling and radiation channels.

\textbf{Key Principle:} Stability arises from a balance of (i) quantum/gradient energy, (ii) interaction energy, and (iii) twist and Kelvin-mode contributions, subject to topological constraints (quantized circulation and discrete projection). Projection invariance on the slice ensures that potential (drainage) adjustments do not alter loop circulation; the solenoidal sector carries the observable circulation.

\subsection{Direct Predictions from the Framework}

A key strength of this framework is its specific, falsifiable predictions, tied to the quintet modes (SUCK, SHAKE, SWIRL, DRAG, WAVE) and particles as flow patterns. These include direct consequences from the mathematical core, focusing on foundational distinctions derived from the postulates.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dark matter vortex structure}: From P-5 (quantized vortices without helical twists) and P-2 (sinks for SUCK/gravity only), dark matter manifests as untwisted vortices, yielding linear/spiral patterns in large-scale structure versus CDM cusps. Observable via JWST + Gaia astrometry, distinguishable from standard dark matter models by qualitatively different distributions.
\item \textbf{Rotation-Magnetism Scaling}: From SWIRL/DRAG modes (P-4/P-5), electromagnetic field strength scales with SWIRL intensity; faster-spinning particles have stronger EM interactions via helical structure. Method: High-precision measurements of spinning charged particles or black hole analogs; validation tie-in: Consistent with Kerr black holes (e.g., M87* with spin parameter $a \approx 0.9$ shows strong magnetic fields scaling with spin).
\item \textbf{Gravitational Waves vs. Photons}: From SHAKE/WAVE distinctions (P-3/P-5), GW are classical 3D waves (WAVE, no quantization, no gravitons as particles); photons are 4D-stabilized packets (always quantized). Method: Gravitational wave detectors (LIGO) vs. photon experiments; search for graviton signatures; distinguishable by never observing discrete gravitons.
\end{itemize}

These core predictions illustrate the framework's internal consistency; broader insights and applications follow in subsequent sections.

\item New perspective on why unification in 3D has failed
\item Topological and energetic criteria for hierarchical stability in braided vortex structures
