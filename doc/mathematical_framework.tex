\section{Introduction to Mathematical Framework}

We model spacetime as a 4D compressible superfluid---an aether---where all forces and particles emerge from the dynamics of topological defects called vortices. Just as whirlpools in water create observable effects through their fluid motion, vortices in the aether manifest as particles and fields. The dynamics naturally separate into three fundamental modes, which we colloquially call the ``three S's'' for intuitive understanding:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Suck}: irrotational flow creating attractive pressure gradients (gravity)
\item \textbf{Swirl}: solenoidal circulation inducing rotational effects (frame-dragging)
\item \textbf{Shake}: oscillatory modes carrying energy as waves (gravitational waves, photons)
\end{itemize}
The irrotational flow (``suck'') creates attractive pressure gradients analogous to gravity. The solenoidal circulation (``swirl'') induces rotational effects like frame-dragging. Oscillatory modes (``shake'') carry energy as waves, manifesting as gravitational waves or photons.

While we use standard notation ($\Psi$ for scalar potential, $A$ for vector potential) in equations, these physical pictures guide our interpretation throughout.

This section develops the mathematical framework, starting with foundational postulates that minimize assumptions while yielding rich emergent physics. We derive unified field equations unifying gravity and electromagnetism, address critical objections like the preferred frame and conservation laws early, detail the 4D-to-3D projection mechanism, calibrate physical constants with minimal parameters, and explore energy considerations for vortex stability. By the end, the framework stands complete, ready for applications in particle masses, cosmology, and beyond.

\subsection{Foundational Postulates}

Before presenting the formal postulates, we address the non-standard dimensional convention for the Gross-Pitaevskii order parameter $\Psi$.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Why $\Psi \sim [L^{-2}]$: A Geometric Necessity}]
Standard 3D GP theory uses $\Psi \sim [M^{1/2} L^{-3/2}]$, but our 4D framework requires $\Psi \sim [L^{-2}]$. This isn't arbitrary---it's mathematically necessary:

\begin{itemize}
\item Vortices are 2D sheets in 4D (codimension-2 defects)
\item These sheets intersect our 3D space at points
\item Projection: $\int$(2D sheet density) $\to \sum$(3D point masses)
\item Standard dimensions would break this projection
\end{itemize}

We explored adding physical membranes to explain this naturally, but found the pure vortex approach cleaner. The dimension emerges from projection geometry, like how string theory requires specific dimensions for consistency.

With our convention: $\rho_{4D} = m |\Psi|^2$ works perfectly for sheet$\to$point projection.
\end{tcolorbox}

We postulate a mathematical structure with these properties and explore its consequences. These axioms provide a compressible 4D medium (P-1) with sources via vortex sinks (P-2), distinct propagation modes (P-3) to handle effective speeds mathematically, flow decomposition (P-4) separating scalar and vector components, and quantized topological features (P-5) with geometric enhancements including phase windings for emergent properties. The dual modes in P-3 are particularly noteworthy: longitudinal waves in the bulk may propagate at speeds potentially exceeding the emergent transverse speed $c$, but observable effects are confined to $c$ through projections, preserving mathematical consistency with causality (detailed in later subsections). All equations have been dimensionally verified using SymPy, ensuring internal coherence.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Postulate 1 (Compressible 4D medium with GP dynamics):} Compressible 4D medium with GP dynamics $\to$ Continuity: $\partial_t \rho_{4D} + \nabla_4 \cdot (\rho_{4D} \mathbf{v}_4) = 0$; Euler: $\partial_t \mathbf{v}_4 + (\mathbf{v}_4 \cdot \nabla_4) \mathbf{v}_4 = -(1/\rho_{4D}) \nabla_4 P$; Barotropic EOS: $P = (g/2) \rho_{4D}^2 / m$. The continuity equation ensures mass conservation in the 4D medium, while Euler describes momentum balance, with ``suck'' dominating pressure gradients.

\textbf{Postulate 2 (Vortex sinks drain into extra dimension):} Vortex sinks drain into extra dimension $\to$ Sink term: $-\sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i})$; Sink strength: $\dot{M}_i = \rho_{4D}^0 \Gamma_i \xi^2$.

\textbf{Postulate 3 (Dual wave modes (bulk $v_L$, vortex oscillations $c$)):} Dual wave modes (bulk $v_L$, vortex oscillations $c$) $\to$ Longitudinal: $v_L = \sqrt{g \rho_{4D}^0 / m}$; Transverse: $c$ emergent from vortex dynamics; Effective: $v_{\text{eff}} = \sqrt{g \rho_{4D}^{\text{local}} / m}$.

\textbf{Postulate 4 (Helmholtz decomposition (suck + swirl)):} Helmholtz decomposition (suck + swirl) $\to$ $\mathbf{v}_4 = -\nabla_4 \Phi + \nabla_4 \times \mathbf{B}_4$. This decomposition separates ``suck'' (irrotational, scalar) from ``swirl'' (solenoidal, vector).

\textbf{Postulate 5 (Quantized vortices with 4-fold projection):} Quantized vortices with 4-fold projection $\to$ Circulation: $\Gamma = n \kappa$ where $\kappa = h / m$; Enhanced: $\Gamma_{\text{obs}} = 4 \Gamma$ (derived in Section 2.6); Vortices as tori/sheets with phase windings; helical twists $\theta + \tau w$ for emergent properties like charge $q = -4 (\hbar / (m c)) (\tau \Gamma) / (2 \sqrt{\phi})$.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Dimensional Check]
$v_L = \sqrt{g \rho_{4D}^0 / m}$: $[L^6 T^{-2}] [M L^{-4}] [M^{-1}] = [L T^{-1}]$ $\checkmark$

$\xi = \hbar / \sqrt{2 m g \rho_{4D}^0}$: $[M L^2 T^{-1}] / \sqrt{[M] [L^6 T^{-2}] [M L^{-4}]} = [L]$ $\checkmark$

$\dot{M}_i = \rho_{4D}^0 \Gamma_i \xi^2$: $[M L^{-4}] [L^2 T^{-1}] [L^2] = [M T^{-1}]$ $\checkmark$

$\rho_{3D} = \rho_{4D}^0 \xi$: $[M L^{-4}] [L] = [M L^{-3}]$ $\checkmark$
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Physical Picture: The Ocean and the Waves}

Before presenting the formal postulates, consider this analogy: Imagine you're floating in the ocean when an underwater earthquake occurs far away. Two distinct things happen:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Bulk redistribution}: The ocean water immediately adjusts its level everywhere as water flows toward the displacement. If you had a perfect pressure sensor, you'd detect this instantly. But floating on the surface, you don't feel it—you move with the water.
\item \textbf{Surface wave}: Later, a tsunami wave arrives, which you definitely feel as it lifts and drops you.
\end{enumerate}

Both phenomena involve the same water, but they represent fundamentally different physics. Our framework captures this duality: gravitational fields are like the bulk flow (established rapidly, unfelt locally), while gravitational waves are like the tsunami (propagating at finite speed, directly observable). The bulk redistribution is like ``suck'' establishing fields rapidly, while the surface wave is ``shake'' propagating observable changes at finite speed.

Same medium, different physics—no separate structures needed!

\draw[thick] (0,0) -- (6,0) node[right] {bulk redistribution at $v_L$ (unobservable)};
\draw[thick,dashed] (0,1) -- (6,1) node[right] {surface wave at $c$ (observable)};
\draw[->] (3,-0.5) -- (3,1.5) node[midway,right] {same medium};
\end{tikzpicture}

The postulates are summarized in the following table:

\label{tab:postulates}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Idea: Foundational axioms as minimal set}

These axioms are chosen minimally to capture key features such as compressibility, sources, wave propagation, flow decomposition, and quantized structures. By deriving consequences from these postulates, we discover mathematical correspondences with physical phenomena, without claiming to describe fundamental reality. The axioms incorporate dual wave modes to ensure consistent propagation and address potential issues like causality in later sections.

From these axioms emerge the trinity of suck, swirl, and shake: suck drives attraction via density deficits and pressure gradients (irrotational flow), swirl stabilizes drainage through helical circulation mirroring electromagnetic fields (solenoidal flow with chiral twists), and shake maintains the structure against bulk pressure via Kelvin wave oscillations with frequency $\omega \sim v_L / \xi$ (arising from the balance of quantum dispersion and interactions in the GP equation (P-1), representing the natural frequency for vortex oscillations against bulk pressure), sourcing rest energy and excitations. Photons arise as shake waves (Kelvin modes) extending into the extra dimension $w$, stabilized by alignment perpendicular to propagation, projecting as transverse polarizations in 3D like slices of ocean waves.

For clarity and dimensional consistency, we define the following key quantities. All projections incorporate the healing length $\xi$ to bridge 4D and 3D descriptions. We define the summation operator over projected quantities in the discrete limit, where $i$ indexes vortex intersections. Surface terms vanish in the discrete projection, as there are no infinite boundaries.

\subsubsection{Dimensional Conventions for 4D-to-3D Projection}
\label{subsec:dimensional_conventions}

This framework employs non-standard dimensional conventions for the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) order parameter $\Psi$, necessitated by the geometric structure of a 4D compressible medium (P-1) and its projection to 3D dynamics (Section 2.6). Here, $\Psi$ denotes the GP order parameter, distinct from the scalar potential $\Psi$ used in the field equations (Sections 2.2, 2.6); context will distinguish usage. Unlike standard 3D GP theory, where the order parameter $\Psi_{3D}$ has dimensions $[M^{1/2} L^{-3/2}]$ to yield a volume density $|\Psi_{3D}|^2 \sim [M L^{-3}]$, our framework defines $\Psi$ with dimensions $[L^{-2}]$. This convention emerges from the 4D density relation $\rho_{4D} = m |\Psi|^2$ (P-1). With $\rho_{4D} \sim [M L^{-4}]$ and $m \sim [M]$, we obtain $|\Psi|^2 \sim [L^{-4}]$ and thus $\Psi \sim [L^{-2}]$. This choice is required for the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vortex Sheet Geometry (P-5)}: Vortices are codimension-2 defects (2D sheets in 4D space), naturally described by a surface-like field $\Psi \sim [L^{-2}]$, reflecting their extension in two spatial dimensions within the 4D medium. This reflects ``swirl'' in codimension-2 defects manifesting as point sources in 3D.
    \item \textbf{Projection Scaling (P-1, P-6)}: Summation over discrete intersections shifts dimensions by one power of length, aligning 4D fields with 3D observables after rescaling with the healing length $\xi$ (Section 2.6).
    \item \textbf{Topological Consistency (P-5)}: Quantized vortices as codimension-2 structures require $\Psi$ to carry phase windings over 2D surfaces, distinct from volume-filling fields in 3D GP theory, ensuring consistency with circulation quantization $\Gamma = n \kappa$ (P-5).
\end{itemize}

These conventions resolve dimensional inconsistencies in the summation process over vortex intersections (Section 2.6), particularly in the continuity equation's sink terms (P-2), and are verified by comprehensive symbolic analysis using SymPy (code available at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}). Standard 3D GP conventions, with $\Psi_{3D} \sim [M^{1/2} L^{-3/2}]$, lead to mismatches in the projection sums, as they assume a 3D volume density incompatible with the 4D vortex sheet geometry and sink terms $\dot{M}_i \propto \rho_{4D}^0 \Gamma_i \xi^2$ (P-2). Note that the interaction term in the GP energy functional includes an explicit factor of $m$ (Section 2.8) to ensure dimensional coherence, as required for vortex sheet geometry where codimension-2 defects necessitate mass loading for drainage and energy balance. $\Psi \sim [L^{-2}]$ from $\rho_{4D} = m |\Psi|^2$ $[M L^{-4}]$, with $m$ $[M]$ ensuring codimension-2 consistency (P-5), and $\xi = \hbar / \sqrt{2 m g \rho_{4D}^0}$ resolving projection sums. Standard 3D GP conventions lead to mismatches, but our 4D form with $m$ fixes this geometrically.

Note that the quantum pressure contributes to the force density as $-n \nabla_4 Q$, where $Q = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\nabla_4^2 \sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{n}}$ and $n = \rho_{4D}/m$ is the boson number density. This ensures dimensional consistency $[M L^{-3} T^{-2}]$ in 4D while reflecting the collective response around vortex defects (P-5). This aligns with the Madelung transform and preserves coherence in projections. 4D alignment resolves to 3D transverse via perpendicular projections, hiding w-mode. This framework supports the three modes: ``suck'' via density deficits, ``swirl'' through phase windings, and ``shake'' as oscillations projecting transversely.

This dimensional framework is essential for the unified field equations (Section 2.2), the 4-fold circulation enhancement (Section 2.6), and the non-circular derivation of deficit-mass equivalence (Section 3.9), demonstrating that apparent ``conventions'' are actually geometric necessities imposed by 4D vortex topology.

\subsection{Unified Field Equations}

From the foundational postulates (P-1 through P-5), we derive the unified field equations governing the dynamics of the 4D compressible superfluid aether. We begin with the continuity and Euler equations (P-1), incorporating vortex sinks (P-2) and dual wave modes (P-3). Using Helmholtz decomposition (P-4), we separate the velocity field into irrotational (scalar) and solenoidal (vector) components, with quantized circulation and helical twists (P-5) providing sources. The dynamics naturally separate into the three fundamental modes: suck (irrotational drainage for gravity), swirl (solenoidal circulation for frame-dragging and electromagnetism), and shake (oscillatory waves for energy propagation). While we reference these modes intuitively in the text, the mathematics uses standard notation without complex trinity forms.

\subsubsection{From Aether Dynamics to Field Equations}

The derivation begins with the 4D equations from P-1 and P-2, now coupled to the vortex core condition $\Psi=0$ at the defect position, incorporating helical twists:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \rho_{4D} + \nabla_4 \cdot (\rho_{4D} \mathbf{v}_4) = -\sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}),
\end{equation}

where $\rho_{4D}$ is the 4D density $[M L^{-4}]$, $\mathbf{v}_4$ the 4-velocity, and $\dot{M}_i = \rho_{4D}^0 \Gamma_i \xi^2$ the sink strength (P-2), with the delta supported on the vortex sheet. Dimensions: LHS $[\partial_t \rho_{4D}] = [M L^{-4} T^{-1}]$, $[\nabla_4 \cdot (\rho_{4D} \mathbf{v}_4)] = [M L^{-4} T^{-1}]$, RHS $[\dot{M}_i \delta^4] = [M T^{-1}] [L^{-4}] = [M L^{-4} T^{-1}]$, consistent.

The Euler equation is:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \mathbf{v}_4 + (\mathbf{v}_4 \cdot \nabla_4) \mathbf{v}_4 = -\frac{1}{\rho_{4D}} \nabla_4 P - \nabla_4 Q,
\end{equation}

with barotropic EOS $P = (g/2) \rho_{4D}^2 / m$ (P-1), yielding local effective speed $v_{\text{eff}} = \sqrt{g \rho_{4D}^{\text{local}} / m}$ (bulk $v_L = \sqrt{g \rho_{4D}^0 / m}$ potentially $\gg c$; observable modes at $c$ from P-3), and $Q$ the quantum pressure $-(\hbar^2 / (2m)) (\nabla_4^2 \sqrt{\rho_{4D}/m} / \sqrt{\rho_{4D}/m})$. Dimensions: LHS $[\partial_t \mathbf{v}_4] = [L T^{-2}]$, $[(\mathbf{v}_4 \cdot \nabla_4) \mathbf{v}_4] = [L T^{-2}]$, RHS $[\nabla_4 P / \rho_{4D}] = [M L^{-2} T^{-2}] [M^{-1} L^{4}] = [L T^{-2}]$, consistent. Helical twists from P-5 introduce a chiral term in the vorticity: $\nabla_4 \times \mathbf{v}_4 = \Omega_0 + (\tau c) \mathbf{n}$ (twist density $\tau$, normal to vortex $\mathbf{n}$, scaled by $c$ for observable shear, sourcing EM currents).

Linearize around background $\rho_{4D} = \rho_{4D}^0 + \delta \rho_{4D}$, $\mathbf{v}_4 = \mathbf{0} + \delta \mathbf{v}_4$ (steady state), and vortex perturbation $\delta R$. The linearized continuity is:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \delta \rho_{4D} + \rho_{4D}^0 \nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -\sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}),
\end{equation}

SymPy confirms linearization; code at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}.

The linearized Euler (dropping quadratic terms):

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -v_{\text{eff}}^2 \nabla_4 (\delta \rho_{4D} / \rho_{4D}^0) - \nabla_4 \delta Q,
\end{equation}

where $\delta P = v_{\text{eff}}^2 \delta \rho_{4D}$ from EOS linearization (differentiate $P(\rho_{4D})$ at $\rho_{4D}^0$ gives $\partial P / \partial \rho_{4D} = g \rho_{4D}^0 / m = v_L^2$, local $\rho_{4D}^{\text{local}}$ for $v_{\text{eff}}$ near deficits), and $\delta Q$ the perturbation in quantum pressure. Dimensions: LHS $[L T^{-2}]$, RHS $[L^2 T^{-2} L^{-1}] [1] = [L T^{-2}]$, consistent. This separation highlights ``suck'' in density perturbations and ``swirl'' in vorticity sources.

The vortex dynamics, derived from varying the GP functional with boundary $\Psi=0$ on the defect, yield Kelvin wave equations for oscillations:

\begin{equation}
\partial^2 R / \partial t^2 = c^2 \nabla^2 R + f_{\text{bulk}} + \omega^2 \delta R,
\end{equation}

where the bulk coupling term follows from the defect advecting with the local flow (motivated by superfluid vortex dynamics in P-1 and P-5), $c$ is the emergent speed for Kelvin modes (calibrated, independent of $v_L$), and the oscillatory term $\omega^2 \delta R$ provides harmonic restoring force for shake stability, with $\omega \sim v_L / \xi$ (arising from the balance of quantum dispersion and interactions in the GP equation (P-1), representing the natural frequency for vortex oscillations against bulk pressure). The linearized vortex equation is $\partial_{tt} \delta R = c^2 \nabla^2 \delta R - (1 / \rho_{4D}^0) \nabla \delta P \cdot n + \omega^2 \delta R$ (coupling term from bulk pressure on defect, with $\delta P$ replacing P for perturbation, and oscillatory term for shake). These Kelvin waves represent ``shake'' modes, coupling to bulk ``suck'' via pressure.

Apply Helmholtz decomposition (P-4) to $\delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -\nabla_4 \Phi + \nabla_4 \times \mathbf{B}_4$, separating compressible (scalar $\Phi$ $[L^2 T^{-1}]$) and incompressible (vector $\mathbf{B}_4$ $[L^2 T^{-1}]$) parts, now with oscillatory modulation in the phase. Taking $\nabla_4 \cdot$ on Euler gives:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t (\nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4) = -v_{\text{eff}}^2 \nabla_4^2 (\delta \rho_{4D} / \rho_{4D}^0) - \nabla_4^2 \delta Q,
\end{equation}

and substituting $\nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -\nabla_4^2 \Phi$ yields the scalar precursor. From linearized continuity:

\begin{equation}
\nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -\frac{1}{\rho_{4D}^0} \left( \partial_t \delta \rho_{4D} + \sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}) \right).
\end{equation}

Differentiate continuity by $t$:

\begin{equation}
\partial_{tt} \delta \rho_{4D} + \rho_{4D}^0 \partial_t (\nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4) = -\sum_i \partial_t \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}),
\end{equation}

and substitute the Euler divergence:

\begin{equation}
\partial_{tt} \delta \rho_{4D} - \rho_{4D}^0 v_{\text{eff}}^2 \nabla_4^2 (\delta \rho_{4D} / \rho_{4D}^0) = -\sum_i \partial_t \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}) + \rho_{4D}^0 \nabla_4^2 \delta Q.
\end{equation}

Combine with $\nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -\nabla_4^2 \Phi$:

\begin{equation}
\partial_{tt} \Phi - v_{\text{eff}}^2 \nabla_4^2 \Phi = v_{\text{eff}}^2 \sum_i \frac{\dot{M}_i}{\rho_{4D}^0} \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}) + v_{\text{eff}}^2 \nabla_4^2 \delta Q / \rho_{4D}^0.
\end{equation}

SymPy confirms the combination; code at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}.

\subsubsection{Scalar Sector: Gravitational Attraction}

This sector corresponds to pure suck: irrotational flow ($\nabla \times \mathbf{v} = 0$) creating attractive pressure gradients, analogous to a bathtub drain pulling water inward (``suck'').

From the Helmholtz decomposition, the scalar potential $\Phi$ satisfies the wave equation derived from combining the linearized continuity and Euler:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{v_{\text{eff}}^2} \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \Phi = \frac{v_{\text{eff}}^2}{\rho_{4D}^0} \sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^3(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i),
\end{equation}

after 3D projection (detailed in Section 2.6). In the static limit, this reduces to the Poisson equation:

\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G \rho_{\text{body}},
\end{equation}

where $\rho_{\text{body}} = \sum_i m_i \delta^3(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i)$ is the effective matter density from aggregated deficits, with $m_i \approx \rho_0 V_{\text{deficit}}$ and calibration $G = c^2 / (4\pi \bar{n} \bar{m} \xi^2)$ (Section 2.7). The acceleration is $\mathbf{a} = -\nabla \Phi$, mimicking Newtonian gravity. In the static limit, this mimics Newtonian gravity via ``suck''-induced inflows. SymPy verifies the derivation from linearized equations; code at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}.

\subsubsection{Electromagnetic Emergence from Dimensional Phase Transition}

While the scalar and vector components of our field equations map naturally to gravitational and gravitomagnetic effects, electromagnetic phenomena require one additional ingredient: the impedance mismatch as aether transitions from 3D to 4D space at vortex boundaries.

\paragraph{The Key Insight: Charge = Suck × Swirl}

Electric charge is not a fundamental property but emerges from the interaction between drainage (suck) and circulation (swirl) at dimensional boundaries. This explains why:
\begin{itemize}
\item Particles with balanced suck and swirl have charge
\item Neutrinos with only swirl have near-zero charge
\item No stable neutral massive particles exist
\end{itemize}

with ``shake'' modulating as energy-carrying waves.

\paragraph{Mathematical Development}

Consider a vortex draining aether from 3D space into the 4D bulk. At the core boundary (radius $\xi$), fluid transitions between dimensions:

In the 3D region ($r > \xi$, $w = 0$), angular momentum has only $x,\,y,\,z$ components. In 4D ($r < \xi$), it gains a $w$-component. This mismatch at the boundary requires a field correction:

\[
L_{3D} = \operatorname{Projection}(L_{4D}) + \text{Field\_correction}
\]

This field correction \emph{is} the electromagnetic field!

At the core boundary (radius $\xi$), we have a 3D region ($r > \xi$, $w = 0$), a transition ($r \approx \xi$, $|w| < \xi$), and 4D drainage ($r < \xi$, $w \in (-\infty,\infty)$). As fluid crosses, angular momentum conservation changes form, creating a mismatch that manifests as electromagnetic fields.

The drainage rate through the boundary:
\begin{equation}
\dot{M} = \iint \rho v_r \, dA = \rho_0 \Gamma \xi^2
\end{equation}

The circulation around the vortex:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma = \oint \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = n\kappa  \quad (\text{quantized})
\end{equation}

At the dimensional boundary, the helical phase $\theta = n\phi + \tau w$ creates a source term:
\begin{equation}
\text{Source} = \partial / \partial w [\rho(\partial \theta / \partial t + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \theta)]|_{\text{boundary}}
\end{equation}

Evaluating with $\tau = \pi/\sqrt{\phi}$ (derived below):
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\text{charge}} = -(e/\epsilon_0) \times (\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\text{unit}}) \times (\Gamma/\kappa) \times (4\text{-fold factor})
\end{equation}

This sources Maxwell's equations:
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot E = \rho_{\text{charge}} / \epsilon_0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\nabla \times B = \mu_0 J + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \partial E / \partial t
\end{equation}

To derive the emergent Maxwell equations, we start with the GP equation, transform to hydrodynamics, linearize around a helical twisted background, include the twist as a vorticity source and oscillation as phase modulation, project to 3D, and map the perturbations to EM fields. This generalization treats the phase perturbation as having vector components (solenoidal from helical twists), consistent with P-4's decomposition, with shake adding oscillatory terms.

Start with the GP equation incorporating helical twist and oscillation (P-1, P-5): The 4D GP is:
\[ i \hbar \partial_t \Psi = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla_4^2 \Psi + g |\Psi|^2 \Psi \]
$\Psi = \sqrt{\rho_{4D} / m} e^{i \theta}$, where $\theta = \theta_{\text{regular}} + \theta_{\text{helical}} + \phi_{\text{shake}}$, $\theta_{\text{helical}} = \tau w$ (helical along $w$, P-5), $\phi_{\text{shake}} = \omega t$ (oscillatory phase for shake).

The Madelung transform yields hydro equations: Imaginary part (continuity):
\[ \partial_t \rho_{4D} + \nabla_4 \cdot (\rho_{4D} \mathbf{v}_4) = 0 \]
Real part (Euler):
\[ \partial_t \mathbf{v}_4 + (\mathbf{v}_4 \cdot \nabla_4) \mathbf{v}_4 = - \frac{1}{\rho_{4D}} \nabla_4 P - \nabla_4 Q \]
$\mathbf{v}_4 = (\hbar / m) \nabla_4 \theta$, $P = (g / 2) \rho_{4D}^2 / m$, $Q = - (\hbar^2 / (2m)) (\nabla_4^2 \sqrt{\rho_{4D} / m} / \sqrt{\rho_{4D} / m})$. The helical twist $\theta_{\text{helical}}$ contributes to $\mathbf{v}_4 = (\hbar / m) \tau \hat{e}_w$ (axial flow), and vorticity $\boldsymbol{\omega}_4 = \nabla_4 \times \mathbf{v}_4 \propto \tau \delta^2(\perp)$, modulated by shake $\phi_{\text{shake}}$ adding oscillatory component. This captures ``swirl'' via helical phases and ``shake'' via oscillations.

Linearizing around the twisted background simplifies to: Background: $\rho_{4D} = \rho_{4D}^0$ (uniform far-field), $\theta = \theta_0$ (helical singular + osc), $\mathbf{v}_{\text{background}} = (\hbar / m) \nabla_4 \theta_0$. Perturbation: $\rho_{4D} = \rho_{4D}^0 + \delta\rho$, $\theta = \theta_0 + \delta\theta$, $\mathbf{v}_4 = \mathbf{v}_{\text{background}} + \delta\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}_{\text{background}} + (\hbar / m) \nabla_4 \delta\theta$. Linear continuity:
\[ \partial_t \delta \rho + \rho_{4D}^0 \nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v} + \delta \rho \nabla_4 \cdot \mathbf{v}_{\text{background}} = 0 \]
Since $\nabla_4 \cdot \mathbf{v}_{\text{background}} = 0$ (solenoidal), simplifies to:
\[ \partial_t \delta \rho + \rho_{4D}^0 \nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v} = 0 \]
Linear Euler (dropping Q for classical EM, as quantum pressure is short-range):
\[ \partial_t \delta \mathbf{v} = - v_{\text{eff}}^2 \nabla_4 (\delta \rho / \rho_{4D}^0) \]
With $v_{\text{eff}}^2 = g \rho_{4D}^0 / m$, now including oscillatory modulation in $\delta \mathbf{v}$ for shake.

Decompose $\delta\mathbf{v} = - \nabla_4 \Phi + \nabla_4 \times \mathbf{B}_4$ (P-4). Scalar part (gravity-like, compressible suck): As above for gravity. Vector part (EM-like, incompressible swirl with shake): From curl Euler, $\partial_t (\nabla_4 \times \delta\mathbf{v}) = 0$ (base linear), but helical twist adds source from background cross terms, and oscillation modulates. Total $\boldsymbol{\omega} = \boldsymbol{\omega}_{\text{background}} + \delta\boldsymbol{\omega} = \nabla_4 \times \mathbf{v}_4$. Linear for $\delta\boldsymbol{\omega} = \nabla_4 \times \delta\mathbf{v} = \nabla_4 \times (\nabla_4 \times \mathbf{B}_4) = - \nabla_4^2 \mathbf{B}_4$ (gauge $\nabla_4 \cdot \mathbf{B}_4 = 0$). From curl Euler, $\partial_t \delta\boldsymbol{\omega} = - \nabla_4 \times [(\mathbf{v}_{\text{background}} \cdot \nabla_4) \delta\mathbf{v} + (\delta\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla_4) \mathbf{v}_{\text{background}}]$ (nonlinear cross, but for effective source, approximates to source ~ curl ($\mathbf{v}_{\text{helical}} \times \delta\mathbf{v}$) ~ $\tau c \delta^2 \times \delta\mathbf{v}$ component, with shake adding $\omega^2$ term). In effective, the vector equation is $\partial_t \delta\boldsymbol{\omega} = \nabla_4 \times (\text{source}_{\text{helical}} + \text{source}_{\text{osc}})$, where $\text{source}_{\text{helical}} = (\tau c / \rho_0) \mathbf{n} \delta^2$, $\text{source}_\text{osc} = \omega^2 \delta R / \rho_{4D}^0$. Then $\partial_t (\nabla_4 \times (\nabla_4 \times \mathbf{B}_4)) = \nabla_4 \times (\text{source})$. But for wave, to include propagation, the full is from the incompressible limit, where the pressure enforces the wave, modulated by shake. Since EM is Kelvin modes, the effective is the wave on vortex line, projected to 3D. The phase $\delta\theta$ satisfies $\nabla^2 \delta\theta = - (m / \hbar \rho_0) \partial_t \delta\rho$ (from cont), but for static, $\nabla^2 \delta\theta = \text{source from helical twist singularity + osc}$. The helical twist singularity makes the laplacian $\nabla^2 \theta = 2\pi \tau \delta^3$ (effective in 3D), so the source is $\rho_q \sim \tau$, with osc adding $\omega$ term. The mapping makes $\nabla^2 \delta\theta = (m / \hbar) \times (4\pi \rho_q / S)$ or scaled, with shake in time deriv. The algebraic is the linear for propagation, and the source from the helical twist singularity in the Poisson limit, modulated by shake. The Maxwell is the eq for the field, with the source from the singularity. The effective is the linear for propagation, and the source from the helical twist singularity in the Poisson limit, modulated by shake.

For the electromagnetic sector, derive from linearizing the GP equation around the vortex core (P-1/P-2, with helical twists from P-5 sourcing perturbations, modulated by Kelvin oscillations). The phase perturbation $\delta \theta$ (dimensionless) and density $\delta \rho_{3D}$ satisfy:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \delta \rho_{3D} + \rho_0 (\hbar / m) \nabla^2 \delta \theta = 0,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \delta \theta = - (g_{3D} / \hbar) \delta \rho_{3D},
\end{equation}

yielding wave equation $\partial_{tt} \delta \rho_{3D} - c^2 \nabla^2 \delta \rho_{3D} = 0$, with $c$ emergent from vortex modes (independent of bulk $v_{\text{eff}}$, now including oscillatory shake as modulation of $\delta \theta$ for energy states).

Map to EM fields with scaling:

\begin{itemize}
\item Scalar potential: $\phi = (g_{3D} / m) \delta \rho_{3D}$ $[L^2 T^{-2}]$ (suck component).
\item Vector potential: $\mathbf{A} = (\hbar / m) \nabla \delta \theta$ $[L T^{-1}]$ (solenoidal from helical twists).
\item Electric field: $\mathbf{E} = - \left[ \nabla \phi + \frac{1}{c} \partial_t \mathbf{A} \right]$ $[M^{1/2} L^{1/2} T^{-2}]$.
\item Magnetic field: $\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}$ $[M^{1/2} L^{-1/2} T^{-1}]$.
\end{itemize}

Charge density: $\rho_q = \sum_i q_i \delta^3(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i)$, with $q_i = -4 (\hbar / (m c)) (\tau \Gamma_i) / (2 \sqrt{\phi}) \sqrt{m / \xi}$ (4-fold from projection, Gaussian units $[M^{1/2} L^{3/2} T^{-1}]$).

Substituting into the linearized equations with helical twist sources as inhomogeneities, modulated by oscillations, yields Maxwell equations (Gaussian convention, $\epsilon_0 = 1$):

\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 4\pi \rho_q, \quad \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{1}{c} \partial_t \mathbf{B}, \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \frac{4\pi}{c} \mathbf{J}_q + \frac{1}{c} \partial_t \mathbf{E},
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{J}_q = \rho_q \mathbf{V}$ (from vortex motion).

Substituting the mapping into the GP-derived equations yields the Maxwell forms. SymPy confirms the mapping and wave equation structure; code at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}.

\paragraph{Why $\tau = \pi/\sqrt{\phi}$ Specifically}

The helical twist angle minimizes the impedance mismatch at the 3D-4D boundary:
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{total}} = E_{\text{mismatch}} + E_{\text{twist}} + E_{\text{drainage}}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $E_{\text{mismatch}} \propto (\partial \theta / \partial w - \tau_{\text{optimal}})^2$  (penalty for impedance mismatch)
\item $E_{\text{twist}} \propto \tau^2 R$  (energy cost of maintaining twist)
\item $E_{\text{drainage}} \propto 1/\tau$  (drainage efficiency)
\end{itemize}

Minimizing $\partial E / \partial \tau = 0$ yields $\tau = \pi/\sqrt{\phi}$, ensuring smooth dimensional transition.

\paragraph{Physical Picture}

Imagine water draining through a hole that connects a 3D surface to a 4D space below. As the water transitions dimensions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Its angular momentum must transform
\item The 3D components map to electromagnetic fields
\item The 4D component becomes the mass flow
\item The coupling strength depends on both flow rate and rotation
\end{enumerate}

This is why charge requires BOTH suck (drainage) and swirl (circulation). Neutrinos, having nearly pure swirl with no drainage, remain essentially neutral despite intense angular momentum.

\paragraph{Connection to Observed Physics}

This mechanism predicts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Charge quantization from boundary conditions
\item No magnetic monopoles (need closed circulation)
\item Exact coupling to give $\alpha \approx 1/137$
\item Natural parity violation from helical structure
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Vector Sector: Frame-Dragging Effects}

This sector corresponds to pure swirl: solenoidal circulation ($\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} = 0$) inducing rotational effects, analogous to a whirlpool (``swirl'') dragging surrounding fluid. For the vector sector, vorticity $\nabla \times \mathbf{v} = \boldsymbol{\omega}$ is sourced by moving vortices (P-5). Define $\mathbf{A} = \sum_i \mathbf{B}_{4,i} / \xi$ $[L T^{-1}]$ (rescaling by division with $\xi$ $[L]$ from P-5's projection reduces dimensions from $[L^2 T^{-1}]$ to $[L T^{-1}]$, preserving geometric 4-fold enhancement from Biot-Savart integrals and aligning with gravitomagnetic form akin to superfluid vortex projections where 4D sheets yield enhanced 3D circulation). Projection with 4-fold enhancement (Section 2.3, Biot-Savart integrals) yields:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{A}}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} = -\frac{16\pi G}{c^2} \mathbf{J}_{\text{mass}} - \frac{4\pi}{c} \mathbf{J}_q,
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{J}_{\text{mass}} = \rho_{\text{body}} \mathbf{V}$ $[M L^{-2} T^{-1}]$, $\mathbf{J}_q = \rho_q \mathbf{V}$ (electromagnetic current from helical twists, with $\rho_q = \sum_i q_i \delta^3(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i)$), and $16\pi G/c^2 = 4$ (geometric) $\times 4$ (gravitomagnetic scaling) $\times \pi G/c^2$; the $4\pi/c$ term for EM arises from helical phase twist projections on the vortex. The $16\pi G/c^2$ term incorporates ``swirl'' enhancements from helical twists. SymPy verifies the wave equation and source terms; code at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}.

\subsubsection{Wave Solutions: The "Shake" Component}

Both gravitational waves and photons emerge as shake modes: oscillatory disturbances propagating at speed $c$, differing only in coupling (mass for GW, charge for photons). The unified treatment uses the wave equation for transverse modes from vortex oscillations:

\begin{equation}
\Box h_{\mu\nu} = -\frac{16\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{quad}} \quad (\text{for GW}),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\Box A^\mu = -\frac{4\pi}{c} J_q^\mu \quad (\text{for photons}),
\end{equation}

where $\Box = \partial_t^2 / c^2 - \nabla^2$. Both emerge as ``shake'' modes on vortices, differing in sources (mass for GW, charge for photons). The tsunami principle (Section 2.5) distinguishes bulk longitudinal adjustments ($v_L > c$, unobservable) from observable transverse shake at $c$. To derive these, consider the linearized GP for transverse perturbations on vortices: The Kelvin wave dispersion $\omega^2 = c^2 k^2 + \omega_0^2$ (with cutoff $\omega_0 \sim v_L / \xi$), projecting to the d'Alembertian form for far-field radiation. For GW, quadrupole sources arise from vortex motion asymmetries; for photons, current from helical oscillations. This unifies ``shake'' across gravity and EM. SymPy confirms the wave solutions and dispersion relations; code at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}.

\subsection{Resolution of the Preferred Frame Problem}

Classical aether theories violate special relativity by defining a preferred rest frame. We show our 4D medium avoids this through Machian dynamics---local frames emerge from balanced cosmic flows.

Historical aether theories posited a medium for wave propagation, which implied a preferred rest frame that would violate special relativity through effects like ether drag. In our mathematical framework, we explore whether such a structure can avoid this issue while preserving observed Lorentz invariance for measurable phenomena.

While stable configurations emerge from the energy functionals (Section 2.6), a potential issue is the implied preferred frame of the 4D medium; we resolve this through Machian principles derived from the postulates, showing that distributed vortices and dual wave modes eliminate a global rest frame.

The resolution emerges naturally from the model's postulates: With vortex sinks distributed throughout the universe (P-2), there is no global rest frame for the medium. Every point experiences flows toward nearby vortices, and a true ``rest'' would require a location equidistant from all matter---an impossibility in a matter-filled cosmos. Instead, local inertial frames arise where cosmic inflows balance, in a Machian sense: The aggregate drainage from distant vortices sets the reference for inertia and rotation.

This addresses the Michelson-Morley null result: Experimental setups co-move with the local flow pattern induced by Earth's vortex structure and surrounding matter. Observable signals propagate via Kelvin wave modes at the fixed speed $c$ (P-3), independent of the bulk longitudinal speed $v_L$. In essence, we are always ``surfing'' our local medium flow, with measurements respecting the emergent $c$ limit.

To add reference to how ``suck'' and ``swirl'' transform properly under boosts: The irrotational suck flow (scalar potential $\Psi$) and solenoidal swirl (vector potential $\mathbf{A}$) transform as components of a unified 4-potential under Lorentz boosts, ensuring invariance. Specifically, under a boost along $x$ with velocity $\beta$, $\Psi' = \gamma (\Psi + \beta c A_x)$ and $A_x' = \gamma (A_x + \beta \Psi / c)$, preserving the field equations. The ``suck'' (scalar $\Psi$) and ``swirl'' (vector $\mathbf{A}$) transform as a 4-potential under Lorentz boosts.

Clarify that $v_{\text{eff}}$ variation provides a natural cutoff, not a preferred frame: Local propagation speed $v_{\text{eff}} = \sqrt{g \rho_{4D}^{\text{local}} / m}$ varies with density, acting as a dynamical regulator that mimics relativistic effects without a fixed frame.

Connect to tsunami principle (bulk vs observable propagation): Bulk adjustments propagate at $v_L > c$ but are unobservable (tsunami bulk redistribution), while measurable disturbances (waves) are confined to $c$.

Emphasize this addresses the \#1 objection to aether theories: By resolving the preferred frame through distributed sources and dual modes, the framework maintains Lorentz invariance emergently.

\begin{tcolorbox}
The aether determines HOW FAST disturbances propagate locally, not WHERE they propagate from.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Mathematical Demonstration}

To demonstrate causality rigorously, consider the 4D wave equation for a scalar perturbation $\phi$:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t^2 \phi - v_L^2 \nabla_4^2 \phi = S(\mathbf{r}_4, t).
\end{equation}

The retarded Green's function in 4D is expressed using the principal value distribution to handle singularities:

\begin{equation}
G_4(t, r_4) = \frac{1}{4 \pi^2 v_L} \, \text{pf} \left[ (v_L^2 t^2 - r_4^2)^{-3/2} \theta(v_L^2 t^2 - r_4^2) \right] \theta(t),
\end{equation}

where $r_4 = \sqrt{r^2 + w^2}$, pf denotes the principal value, and the normalization ensures dimensional consistency $[T L^{-4}]$. This form incorporates the light-cone singularity in a well-defined distributional sense, with support on and inside the cone $t \geq r_4 / v_L$. The 4D retarded Green's function (see Appendix A for derivation) preserves causality while allowing bulk adjustments. This preserves causality for ``shake'' modes at $c$, while bulk ``suck'' adjusts unobservably.

The projected propagator on the $w=0$ slice is now discrete, summing contributions from vortex intersections rather than integrating over $w$:

\begin{equation}
G_{\text{proj}}(t, r) = \sum_i G_4(t, \sqrt{r^2 + w_i^2}),
\end{equation}

where $w_i$ are discrete offsets for each vortex $i$ (e.g., small for charged particles, larger for neutrinos). The projected propagation preserves bulk support for $t \geq r / v_L$, potentially $>c$. However, observable signals---such as gravitational waves or light---are Kelvin wave modes fixed at $c$. Longitudinal bulk modes adjust steady-state configurations mathematically but do not carry information to 3D observers, as vortex particles couple primarily to Kelvin modes. The healing length $\xi$ regularizes the core, smearing the projected fronts over $\Delta t \sim \xi^2 / (2 r v_L)$, effectively limiting to $c$. Symbolic summation confirms the projected lightcone support is confined to $t \geq r / c$ for Kelvin components.

The background density $\rho_0$ sources a quadratic potential $\Psi \supset 2\pi G \rho_0 r^2$, but global inflows yield $\Psi_{\text{global}} \approx 2\pi G \langle \rho \rangle r^2$, canceling if $\langle \rho_{\text{cosmo}} \rangle = \rho_0$. Residual asymmetry predicts $G$ anisotropy $\sim 10^{-13} \,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, consistent with bounds. Twists from emergent electromagnetism (universal orientation in $y$-$w$ plane) do not break this resolution, as they align with the projected geometry without introducing a preferred direction.

\subsubsection{Resolution of the Apparent Paradox}

How can gravitational effects seem ``instantaneous'' for orbits while gravitational waves travel at $c$?

\textbf{Answer}: They're different phenomena!
\begin{itemize}
\item Orbital mechanics depends on the steady flow pattern $\Phi$
\item This pattern adjusts through the bulk at $v_L \gg c$
\item But we move with the flow (equivalence principle)
\item Only changes in the pattern (waves) are observable at $c$
\end{itemize}
Orbital mechanics depends on steady ``suck'' flow... Changes (``shake'' waves) observable at $c$. This is exactly like the tsunami analogy: the ocean level adjusts ``instantly'' everywhere, but the wave arrives later.

\subsubsection{Causality Check}

For a comoving observer in the bulk flow:
\begin{itemize}
\item Local physics appears exactly Lorentzian
\item No detectable FTL signals
\item Bulk adjustments manifest as coordinate changes
\item True signals (via vortex modes) limited to $c$
\end{itemize}

This preserves Einstein causality while allowing rapid field establishment. $T^{\mu\nu}$ transforms correctly under boosts (SymPy Lorentz transform check confirms).

\subsubsection{Implications}

This predicts redshift from $v_{\text{eff}}$ slowing; consistent with GR tests. Near masses, $v_{\text{eff}} \approx c \left(1 - \frac{G M}{2 c^2 r}\right)$ (from $\delta \rho_{4D} / \rho_{4D}^0 \approx - G M / (c^2 r)$).

\subsubsection{Trinity Tie-In}

The trinity integrates naturally:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Suck}: Bulk drainage setup (gravitational field)
\item \textbf{Swirl}: Helical stability (electromagnetic fields)
\item \textbf{Shake}: Kelvin waves for GW/photons (observable energy transfer)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conservation Laws and Aether Drainage}

The 4D compressible medium (P-1) ensures global conservation laws hold despite local drainage from vortex sinks (P-2), as flux redirects into the extra dimension without loss. This resolves apparent non-conservation in 3D projections (Section 2.6) while maintaining consistency with dual wave modes (P-3) and quantized topology (P-5). The framework derives these laws from the Gross-Pitaevskii structure (P-1), incorporating boundary conditions for vortex sheets. We shift to discrete projections, aggregating over finite vortex intersections rather than continuous integrals over $w$. This simplifies boundary handling while preserving the original global principles. The trinity integrates naturally: suck (drainage) appears as apparent mass removal in 3D but is conserved in 4D via bulk redirection; swirl (helicity) preserves topological invariants like charge through phase windings; shake (Kelvin waves) conserves energy by converting to bulk modes or observable radiation (e.g., photons as vortex oscillations).

Drainage $\equiv$ net flux $\Phi = \int \rho \mathbf{v} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} \, dA$ through hypersurface at $w = \text{const}$. Drainage creates ``suck'' but doesn't deplete the medium, as it draws from the infinite 4D reservoir.

\subsubsection{Global Conservation}
Although the sinks introduce effective inhomogeneities in the 3D equations, the full 4D continuity ensures no net loss. To derive this explicitly, integrate the 4D continuity equation from the postulates (P-1 and P-2) over all 4D space:

\begin{equation}
\int d^4 r \left[ \partial_t \rho_{4D} + \nabla_4 \cdot (\rho_{4D} \mathbf{v}_4) \right] = \int d^4 r \left[ -\sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}) \right].
\end{equation}

The divergence term integrates to a surface integral at infinity, which vanishes by the boundary conditions ($\mathbf{v}_4 \to 0$ as $|\mathbf{r}_4| \to \infty$), yielding

\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt} \int \rho_{4D} \, d^4 r = -\sum_i \dot{M}_i,
\end{equation}

where the drained ``mass'' is redirected into the infinite bulk along the extra dimension $w \to \pm \infty$, acting as a reservoir without back-reaction on the $w=0$ slice. This ensures ``suck'' flux conservation in 4D despite 3D deficits. In the discrete 3D projection (P-6), we aggregate over vortex intersections without an averaging operator, directly defining projected quantities as sums. This yields the effective 3D continuity:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \rho_{3D} + \nabla \cdot (\rho_{3D} \mathbf{v}) = -\sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^3(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i).
\end{equation}

Similar projections apply to the Euler equation, producing effective 3D dynamics with sink sources that appear as apparent mass removal while preserving global conservation in 4D (detailed in bulk dissipation below). Physically, this is like discrete underwater drains vanishing water from the surface view, thinning the medium and inducing inflows that mimic attraction. Like a waterfall that never empties the river above, the drainage draws from the infinite 4D structure (infinite reservoir), with re-emergence from bulk modes maintaining balance.

By Noether's theorem, continuous symmetries yield conservation laws. Our 4D translations preserve total mass-energy despite local drainage. The framework connects to particle creation/annihilation symmetry: Creation corresponds to vortex-antivortex pair formation (conserving net drainage, as antivortices act as sources balancing sinks), while annihilation releases shake energy into bulk modes or radiation, preserving total energy in 4D.

\subsubsection{Microscopic Drainage Mechanism}
At the vortex cores, drainage occurs through phase singularities in the order parameter $\Psi=0$ at the defect position, incorporating helical twists.

\textbf{Key Idea:} Drainage through phase singularities.

Drainage occurs through phase singularities in the order parameter $\Psi=0$ over the healing length $\xi$. The phase winds by $2\pi n$, creating a flux into the extra dimension. To approximate this, near the core, the drainage velocity is

\begin{equation}
v_w \approx \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi r_4},
\end{equation}

where $r_4 = \sqrt{\rho^2 + w^2}$ and $\Gamma$ is the circulation, with far-field decay $v_w \sim 1/|w|$. The total sink strength for each vortex is obtained by aggregating the flux over the effective core area $\sim \pi \xi^2$ in the perpendicular plane:

\begin{equation}
\dot{M}_i = \rho_{4D}^0 \sum v_w \, dA_w \approx \rho_{4D}^0 \Gamma \xi^2,
\end{equation}

where the sum approximates the core cross-section times average velocity (SymPy integrations confirm the flux approximation, yielding exact factors independent of cutoff). Here, $\Gamma = n \kappa$ with $\kappa = h / m$ (from GP phase quantization in P-1). Reconnections act as ``valves,'' releasing flux into bulk modes, with energy barriers

\begin{equation}
\Delta E \approx \rho_{4D}^0 \Gamma^2 \xi^2 \ln(L / \xi) / (4\pi)
\end{equation}

preventing uncontrolled leakage.

With helical twists (Section 4), drainage couples to charge: Twisted vortices have enhanced $\dot{M}_i \propto \tau \Gamma$ (twist density $\tau$), but conservation holds as twists preserve topology during reconnections. Shake vibrations (Kelvin waves) modulate the core, adding a small oscillatory term to $v_w$ ($\delta v_w \sim \omega \delta R$), but average flux unchanged, with energy conserved via radiation.

\subsubsection{Bulk Dissipation}
To prevent accumulation and back-reaction, the bulk continuity includes a dissipation term converting flux to non-interacting excitations:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \rho_{\text{bulk}} + \partial_w (\rho_{\text{bulk}} v_w) = -\gamma \rho_{\text{bulk}},
\end{equation}

with rate $\gamma \sim v_L / L_{\text{univ}}$, where $L_{\text{univ}}$ is the universe scale (e.g., Hubble length), setting the dissipation horizon where flux converts to non-interacting modes. The drainage geometry motivates directional flow: $v_w = \text{sign}(w) \cdot v$ where $v > 0$ is the outflow magnitude, reflecting symmetric outward flux from the central $w=0$ slice (sinks as bidirectional drains, per P-2). The scale $v \sim v_L$ emerges from bulk longitudinal modes at $v_L = \sqrt{g \rho_{4D}^0 / m}$ (governing rapid adjustments in the compressible medium, P-1), while observables remain confined to Kelvin wave modes at $c$.

\textbf{Key Idea:} Symmetric outward drainage with dissipation.

We solve piecewise for $w > 0$ and $w < 0$, assuming steady state ($\partial_t \rho_{\text{bulk}} = 0$) for the spatial part to capture long-term equilibrium (no ongoing accumulation), while retaining transient time dependence $e^{-\gamma t}$ as a multiplier for initial perturbations decaying over short timescales.

\begin{itemize}
\item For $w > 0$: $v_w = +v$, so $v \partial_w \rho_{\text{bulk}} = -\gamma \rho_{\text{bulk}}$ yields $\partial_w \rho_{\text{bulk}} = -(\gamma / v) \rho_{\text{bulk}}$. Solution: $\rho_{\text{bulk}}(w) = \rho(0^+) e^{-w / \lambda}$ with $\lambda = v / \gamma$.
\item For $w < 0$: $v_w = -v$, so $-v \partial_w \rho_{\text{bulk}} = -\gamma \rho_{\text{bulk}}$ yields $\partial_w \rho_{\text{bulk}} = (\gamma / v) \rho_{\text{bulk}}$. Solution: $\rho_{\text{bulk}}(w) = \rho(0^-) e^{w / \lambda} = \rho(0^-) e^{-|w| / \lambda}$ (since $w < 0$).
\end{itemize}

Assuming symmetry ($\rho(0^+) = \rho(0^-) = \rho_{\text{inj}}$, injected from sinks), the overall form is

\begin{equation}
\rho_{\text{bulk}}(w) = \rho_{\text{inj}} \, e^{-\gamma t} \, e^{-|w| / \lambda},
\end{equation}

where the $e^{-\gamma t}$ term accounts for transient decay of initial conditions (optional for pure steady-state analysis, set to 1 if $\partial_t = 0$ globally). This satisfies the equation for $w \neq 0$ (SymPy-solved: substitute into ODE confirms exact).

At $w=0$, differentiating $\partial_w (\rho_{\text{bulk}} v_w)$ globally introduces a delta function: $\partial_w [\text{sign}(w) v \rho_{\text{bulk}}] = \text{sign}(w) v \partial_w \rho_{\text{bulk}} + 2 v \rho_{\text{bulk}} \delta(w)$. The first term equals $-\gamma \rho_{\text{bulk}}$ (from piecewise), while $+2 v \rho_{\text{inj}} \delta(w)$ represents the positive source injection at $w=0$ (flux from P-2 vortex sinks), balancing the equation without additional terms. Physically, this delta encodes the topological discontinuity from drainage, ensuring energy conversion to bulk modes without back-reaction on the $w=0$ slice.

This ensures constant background $\rho_{4D}^0$ and $\dot{G} = 0$, consistent with bounds $|\dot{G}/G| \lesssim 10^{-13} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Shake energy (Kelvin waves) dissipates similarly, converting to bulk modes or photons, preserving total energy in 4D.

Analogously, this dissipation mimics energy conversion to heat in a vast reservoir, maintaining equilibrium. For twisted vortices (EM context), dissipation preserves charge topology, as windings are conserved invariants.

\subsubsection{Machian Balance}
The uniform background $\rho_0$ sources a quadratic potential term. From the scalar Poisson equation $\nabla^2 \Psi = -4\pi G \rho_0$ (background as effective negative source for consistency with deficits),

\begin{equation}
\Psi \supset -\frac{2\pi G \rho_0}{3} r^2,
\end{equation}

implying acceleration

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{a} = -\nabla \Psi = \frac{4\pi G \rho_0}{3} \mathbf{r}
\end{equation}

(corrected for units $[\Psi] = [L^2 T^{-2}]$, as verified from field equations; outward for background push). Global inflows from cosmic matter (discrete vortices) provide a counter-term:

\begin{equation}
\Psi_{\text{global}} \approx \frac{2\pi G \langle \rho \rangle}{3} r^2,
\end{equation}

cancelling if $\langle \rho_\text{cosmo} \rangle = \rho_0$ (aggregate deficits balancing background). Residual asymmetry predicts $G$ anisotropy $\sim 10^{-13} \,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, a testable pattern.

In the EM extension, twists add no net background (neutral on average), preserving the balance. Shake vibrations (Kelvin waves) contribute a small positive energy density to $\langle \rho \rangle$ (as $\rho_{\text{vib}} / c^2$), but this is microscopic and averages out cosmologically, maintaining the equilibrium. The tsunami principle reinforces this: bulk flows are unfelt locally (we move with them), while observable changes propagate at $c$.

\subsection{The Tsunami Principle}

To understand how our framework reconciles the speed of gravity with observational constraints, consider ocean tsunami waves. The wave disturbance travels at speed $v_{\text{tsunami}} \approx \sqrt{g d}$, but this represents the phase velocity of the wave pattern. Individual water particles move much slower, and any debris (observable matter) is carried at the group velocity.

Similarly, in our aether:
\begin{itemize}
\item Longitudinal density adjustments propagate at $v_L \gg c$ through the 4D bulk
\item Observable effects in the 3D slice propagate at $c = \sqrt{T / \sigma}$
\item Matter (vortices) responds to local flow, not bulk adjustments
\end{itemize}

This dual propagation ensures:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Orbital mechanics remain stable (bulk adjusts quickly)
\item Causality is preserved (signals limited to $c$)
\item Both requirements are satisfied without paradox
\end{enumerate}

We call bulk density adjustments propagating at $v_L > c$ ``tsunamis''---they establish fields rapidly but remain unobservable, like ocean depth changes vs surface waves.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Why Two Speeds Without Membranes]
Early versions of this framework added physical membranes at vortex cores
to explain $c \neq v_L$. We discovered this was unnecessary---the same 4D medium
naturally supports two propagation modes:

\begin{itemize}
\item Bulk density waves: Entire medium responds (speed $v_L$)
\item Vortex oscillations: Kelvin waves on defects (speed $c$)
\end{itemize}

Like how ocean water supports both pressure waves (fast, through bulk)
and surface waves (slower, confined to interface), no separate structures
needed!
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Mathematical Demonstration}

\textbf{Key Idea: Bulk vs. observable responses in the same medium.}

Consider a mass $M$ that suddenly appears at the origin. In our framework:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bulk Response} (Gravitational Field): The density perturbation satisfies:
\begin{equation}
\partial_t^2 \delta\rho - v_L^2 \nabla_4^2 \delta\rho = -M\delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4)\delta(t)
\end{equation}
This ``suck'' spreads rapidly but unobservably. The solution spreads at speed $v_L$ through the 4D bulk. For the steady-state gravitational potential:
\begin{equation}
\Phi(\mathbf{r},t) \approx -\frac{GM}{r} \theta(t - r/v_L)
\end{equation}
But we don't directly observe this---we move with the flow!

\item \textbf{Observable Response} (Gravitational Waves): Vortex oscillations propagate via:
\begin{equation}
\Box h_{\mu\nu} = -\frac{16\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
These travel at speed $c$ and are directly detectable.
\end{itemize}

Here $\nabla_4^2 \equiv \partial^2/\partial x^2 + \partial^2/\partial y^2 + \partial^2/\partial z^2 + \partial^2/\partial w^2$ acts on all four spatial coordinates.

\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw (0,0) -- (4,4) node[above] {$v_L$ cone (wide)};
\draw (0,0) -- (2,4) node[above] {$c$ cone (narrow)};
\draw (0,0) node[below] {event};
\end{tikzpicture}

\captionof{figure}{Spacetime diagram showing $v_L$ cone (wide) vs $c$ cone (narrow), with caption explaining observable vs field establishment.}

Dimensions for bulk equation: LHS $[\delta\rho] / T^2 \sim M L^{-4} T^{-2}$, RHS source $M \delta^4 \delta(t) \sim M L^{-4} T^{-1}$ (impulse; consistent with rate interpretation). SymPy confirms wave equation structure and Heaviside solution form; code at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}.

\subsubsection{Resolution of the Apparent Paradox}

\textbf{Key Idea: Different phenomena resolve speed paradox.}

How can gravitational effects seem ``instantaneous'' for orbits while gravitational waves travel at $c$?

\textbf{Answer}: They're different phenomena!
\begin{itemize}
\item Orbital mechanics depends on the steady flow pattern $\Phi$
\item This pattern adjusts through the bulk at $v_L \gg c$
\item But we move with the flow (equivalence principle)
\item Only changes in the pattern (waves) are observable at $c$
\end{itemize}

Orbital mechanics depends on steady ``suck'' flow... Changes (``shake'' waves) observable at $c$. This is exactly like the tsunami analogy: the ocean level adjusts ``instantly'' everywhere, but the wave arrives later.

\subsubsection{Causality Check}

\textbf{Key Idea: Local Lorentzian physics preserved.}

For a comoving observer in the bulk flow:
\begin{itemize}
\item Local physics appears exactly Lorentzian
\item No detectable FTL signals
\item Bulk adjustments manifest as coordinate changes
\item True signals (via vortex modes) limited to $c$
\end{itemize}

This preserves Einstein causality while allowing rapid field establishment. $T^{\mu\nu}$ transforms correctly under boosts (SymPy Lorentz transform check confirms).

\subsubsection{Implications}

\textbf{Key Idea: Predictions from dual modes.}

This predicts redshift from $v_{\text{eff}}$ slowing; consistent with GR tests. Near masses, $v_{\text{eff}} \approx c \left(1 - \frac{G M}{2 c^2 r}\right)$ (from $\delta \rho_{4D} / \rho_{4D}^0 \approx - G M / (c^2 r)$).

\subsubsection{Trinity Tie-In}

The trinity integrates naturally:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Suck}: Bulk drainage setup (gravitational field)
\item \textbf{Swirl}: Helical stability (electromagnetic fields)
\item \textbf{Shake}: Kelvin waves for GW/photons (observable energy transfer)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{4D to 3D Projection}

Building on the field equations derived in the previous subsection, we now detail the projection mechanism that maps the 4D mathematical structure to effective 3D dynamics. In this approach, we shift from continuous integration over the extra dimension $w$ to discrete summing over vortex sheet intersections with the $w=0$ hypersurface. This transforms vortex sheets in 4D (codimension-2 defects from P-5) into point-like sources and enhanced circulation in 3D, while preserving the geometric 4-fold enhancement. The process relies on the compressible medium (P-1) with sinks (P-2) draining into the extra dimension, while dual wave modes (P-3) ensure observable propagation at $c$ despite bulk speeds $v_L > c$. We begin with the continuity projection to illustrate effective sources, then derive the geometric 4-fold enhancement for circulation. Discrete projection follows P-6, aggregating over finite vortex counts without the averaging operator $\overline{X}$.

To derive the projection explicitly, start with the 4D continuity equation from the postulates (P-1 and P-2):

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \rho_{4D} + \nabla_4 \cdot (\rho_{4D} \mathbf{v}_4) = -\sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}),
\end{equation}

where $\rho_{4D}$ is the 4D density $[M L^{-4}]$, $\mathbf{v}_4$ the 4-velocity, and $\dot{M}_i = \rho_{4D}^0 \Gamma_i \xi^2$ the sink strength (P-2), with the delta supported on the vortex sheet. Dimensions: LHS $[\partial_t \rho_{4D}] = [M L^{-4} T^{-1}]$, $[\nabla_4 \cdot (\rho_{4D} \mathbf{v}_4)] = [M L^{-4} T^{-1}]$, RHS $[\dot{M}_i \delta^4] = [M T^{-1}] [L^{-4}] = [M L^{-4} T^{-1}]$, consistent.

To illustrate the projection, consider a simple example: a vortex sheet in 4D as a tilted disk (e.g., like a coin embedded at an angle in a block of jelly). In the $w=0$ slice, this appears as an elliptical intersection, but for topological defects, the projection aggregates flows from multiple geometric contributions, yielding point-like sources with enhanced effects. This tilted disk analogy highlights how the 4D extension creates multiple effective pathways for circulation and drainage, naturally leading to the 4-fold enhancement.

The effective 3D density is defined via discrete projection as

\begin{equation}
\rho_{3D}(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_0 - \sum_i m_i \delta^3(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i),
\end{equation}

where $\rho_0 = \rho_{4D}^0 \xi$ is the projected background density (P-1, P-3), and $m_i$ is the deficit mass associated with vortex $i$, with $\mathbf{r}_i$ its intersection point. This form captures the apparent matter density $\rho_{\text{body}} = \sum_i m_i \delta^3(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i)$ as aggregated deficits, sourcing the field equations (Section 2.2). Dimensions: $\rho_{3D} [M L^{-3}] = [M L^{-4}] [L]$, consistent.

For the velocity field, the projection involves summing contributions from the 4D flow. The 4-fold enhancement arises naturally from four geometric components in the tilted disk example:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Direct Intersection}: The vortex sheet crosses $w=0$ at a point, contributing base circulation $\Gamma$. This is base ``swirl''.
\item \textbf{Upper Hemisphere Projection}: Flow from $w>0$ induces a hemispherical contribution, adding $\Gamma$.
\item \textbf{Lower Hemisphere Projection}: Similarly from $w<0$, adding another $\Gamma$.
\item \textbf{Induced $w$-Flow}: Drainage along $w$ creates a corrective flow, contributing the final $\Gamma$. This is corrective ``suck''.
\end{itemize}

To derive this mathematically, consider the Biot-Savart law for the velocity field induced by a vortex sheet in 4D:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}_4(\mathbf{r}_4) = \frac{\Gamma}{4\pi} \int \frac{(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_4') \times d\mathbf{l}_4'}{|\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_4'|^3},
\end{equation}

where the integral is over the sheet's boundary curve. For a toroidal sheet, discretizing the projection sums the contributions, yielding $\Gamma_{\text{obs}} = 4\Gamma$ exactly (verified by symbolic integration with SymPy; code at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}). This enhancement applies to sources in the field equations, explaining the factors like $16\pi G/c^2 = 4 \times 4 \times \pi G/c^2$ (Section 2.2). This sums ``swirl'' contributions geometrically.

More intuition: Imagine slicing a 4D whirlpool—the cross-section reveals multiple flow lines converging, amplifying the apparent strength in 3D. This geometric multiplicity ensures the projection preserves topological invariants while enhancing observable effects.

Connecting to experimental tests, the 4-fold enhancement predicts gravitomagnetic fields four times stronger than naive expectations, aligning with frame-dragging measurements from Gravity Probe B (consistent within errors) and post-Newtonian parameters in general relativity. For electromagnetic emergence (Section 2.2.3), it quantizes charge via boundary conditions, testable in precision QED experiments like anomalous magnetic moment.

\subsection{Calibration of Physical Constants}

Having established the projection mechanism that yields geometric enhancements like the 4-fold factor in vortex circulation, we now calibrate the mathematical framework to align with empirical observations, demonstrating its remarkable parsimony. The model requires only three calibrated parameters---Newton's gravitational constant $G$, the speed of light $c$, and the background density $\rho_0$---while all other quantities emerge directly from the foundational postulates (P-1 to P-6) without additional adjustments. The framework derives relations from 4D axioms, rescales via discrete projection geometry (detailed in 2.6, motivated by vortex density $\bar{n}$ from cosmology and microscopic healing length $\xi$ from P-1), and calibrates minimally to $G$/$c$/$\rho_0$ for alignment with observations. This isn't fitting but predictive: e.g., $16\pi G/c^2$ emerges as $4$ (P-5 geometry) $\times 4$ (gravitomagnetic scaling) $\times \pi G/c^2$, forecasting post-Newtonian effects like perihelion advance without extras. This minimal parameter count, relying on geometric and topological principles, contrasts with models like the Standard Model of particle physics, which requires approximately 20 free parameters, and underscores the framework's ability to generate complex dynamics from simple axioms. Calibration anchors the model to well-established measurements, such as the Cavendish experiment for $G$ or interferometry for $c$, ensuring predictions align with observed phenomena without retrofitting. We derive key coefficients, connect them to the postulates, and highlight their physical implications. Dimension shifts for the potentials (to $[L^2 T^{-2}]$ for $\Psi$ and $[L T^{-1}]$ for $\mathbf{A}$) align with observed physics via $G$ and $c$ without extras.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Parameter Values]
\textbf{CALIBRATED (from observation):}
\begin{itemize}
\item $G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11}$ m$^3$ kg$^{-1}$ s$^{-2}$
\item $c = 2.998 \times 10^8$ m/s
\item $\rho_0 = $ [derived value] kg/m$^3$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{DERIVED (from postulates):}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\xi \approx 10^{-15}$ m (Planck-scale)
\item 4-fold factor: Exactly 4 (geometric)
\item $\phi = 1.618\dots$ (from $x^2 = x + 1$)
\item $v_L$ (bulk longitudinal speed)
\item $\bar{n}$ (vortex density, from cosmology)
\item $\theta_{\text{twist}} = \pi / \sqrt{\phi}$ (helical twist angle for charge)
\item $\alpha^{-1} = 360 \phi^{-2} - 2 \phi^{-3} + (3 \phi)^{-5} \approx 137.036$
\item $\omega \sim v_L / \xi$ (Kelvin wave frequency)
\item $G_F$ (Fermi constant, calibrated for weak)
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

The primary calibration arises in the scalar sector, where the gravitational constant $G$ emerges from the far-field limit of the scalar field equation (derived in Section 2.2):

\[
\frac{1}{v_{\text{eff}}^2} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \Psi = 4\pi G \rho_{\text{body}}.
\]

In the static limit ($\partial_t \Psi \approx 0$), this reduces to the Newtonian Poisson equation, $\nabla^2 \Psi = 4\pi G \rho_{\text{body}}$, where $\rho_{\text{body}}$ is the effective matter density from aggregated vortex deficits. The coefficient $4\pi G$ results from discrete summing over vortex intersections (Section 2.6), with the background density $\rho_0 = \rho_{4D}^0 \xi$ (projected 3D density, with $\xi$ microscopic core scale). Specifically, linearizing the 4D continuity around $\rho_{4D} = \rho_{4D}^0 + \delta \rho_{4D}$ and projecting yields the source term, where the calibration is fixed by:

\boxed{
G = \frac{c^2}{4\pi \bar{n} \bar{m} \xi^2}
}

as derived from matching the far-field to the Newtonian limit (e.g., Cavendish experiment). Here, $\bar{n}$ is the vortex density (number per unit volume, derived from cosmology as $\bar{n} \approx \rho_{\text{critical}} / m_{\text{avg}}$, where $\rho_{\text{critical}}$ is the critical density of the universe), $\bar{m}$ is the average deficit mass per vortex (microscopic scale), and $\xi$ (healing length, [L]) acts as the effective core regularization scale, not a free parameter but derived from P-1 as $\xi = \hbar / \sqrt{2 m g \rho_{4D}^0}$. This expression locks the overall scale, ensuring higher-order post-Newtonian (PN) corrections (e.g., perihelion advance, Section 4) emerge without additional inputs, as verified symbolically with SymPy (code available at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}).

In the vector sector, the coefficient in the field equation:

\[
\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{A}}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} = -\frac{16\pi G}{c^2} \mathbf{J},
\]

decomposes as $\frac{16\pi G}{c^2} = 4 \times 4 \times \frac{\pi G}{c^2}$. The first factor of 4 arises from the geometric projection of the 4D vortex sheet (Section 2.6, P-5), where four contributions (direct intersection, upper/lower hemispherical projections, and induced $w$-flow) each yield circulation $\Gamma$, summing to $\Gamma_{\text{obs}} = 4\Gamma$. The second factor of 4 reflects the gravitomagnetic scaling inherent to vortex dynamics, aligning with relativistic frame-dragging predictions (e.g., Lense-Thirring precession) without adjustment. This decomposition is exact, as confirmed by symbolic integration of the 4D Biot-Savart law (Section 2.6), and ensures the vector sector matches general relativity's predictions precisely.

\boxed{
\frac{16\pi G}{c^2} = 4 \times 4 \times \frac{\pi G}{c^2}
}

The parameters are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:parameters}, distinguishing those derived from postulates (e.g., $\xi$, 4-fold factor) from those calibrated ($G$, $c$, $\rho_0$). The postulates contribute as follows: P-1 (GP dynamics) provides $\xi$ and $v_L = \sqrt{g \rho_{4D}^0 / m}$; P-3 defines dual wave modes ($v_L$, $c$, $v_{\text{eff}}$); P-5 yields the 4-fold factor and quantized circulation $\Gamma = n \kappa$; and $\rho_0$ follows from projection. The golden ratio $\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ emerges from energy minimization (Section 2.1.6), solving the recurrence $x^2 = x + 1$, a geometric feature of vortex braiding. The twist angle $\theta_{\text{twist}} = \pi / \sqrt{\phi}$ (for emergent charge) is derived from chiral winding in P-5. The fine structure constant $\alpha^{-1} = 360 \phi^{-2} - 2 \phi^{-3} + (3 \phi)^{-5}$ emerges from twist dilution and projections, as detailed in the emergent electromagnetism section. The Fermi constant $G_F$ (for weak interactions) is noted as a potential fourth calibration, hinted in later sections, but gravity and electromagnetism require only $G$, $c$, and $\rho_0$.

\end{table}

This minimal calibration---$G$, $c$, and $\rho_0$ fixing gravity and electromagnetism, with $G_F$ for weak interactions---produces rich dynamics, such as perihelion advance or frame-dragging, without additional parameters, unlike the Standard Model's numerous Yukawa couplings. The geometric and topological origins (e.g., 4-fold factor from P-5, $\phi$ from energy minimization) highlight why this framework reproduces observed patterns so effectively, inviting further exploration of its mathematical economy. This minimalism mirrors Kaluza-Klein models, where compactification yields unified predictions; here, topology (P-5) and dual modes (P-3) generate rich dynamics testable in astrophysics.

\subsubsection{Parameter Independence Verification}

Our three scales are mathematically independent:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\xi$: Set by quantum/classical boundary ($\hbar$, $m$, $g$, $\rho_{4D}^0$)
\item $\lambda_{\text{cosmo}}$: Set by matter distribution (observational)
\item $c$: Emergent from vortex dynamics (not derived)
\end{itemize}

No combination of $\xi$ and $\lambda$ yields $c$, preventing overconstraint. Crucially: no mathematical relation forces $c = f(v_L)$. The tsunami principle avoids overconstraint by allowing $v_L \gg c$ for different phenomena.

\subsection{Energy Considerations and Stability}

To understand the persistence of certain vortex configurations within this mathematical framework, we explore energy functionals derived from the Gross-Pitaevskii-like structure introduced in the postulates. These functionals identify stable and unstable states, where minima correspond to persistent patterns and saddles to transient ones. We also derive a timescale hierarchy that justifies treating vortex cores as quasi-steady on macroscopic scales. Additionally, we establish the topological protection for braided vortex stability, ensuring resonance-free, scale-invariant structures. These features tie to postulates P-1 (Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics), P-2 (vortex sinks), P-3 (dual wave modes), and P-5 (quantized vortices with topological constraints), providing insight into why certain structures endure and how they encode geometric patterns predictive of physical phenomena. With the hybrid approach, we enhance the functionals to include contributions from phase twists, tying to emergent charge properties, and incorporate discrete vortex projections for particle-like stability.

The foundational energy functional for the order parameter $\Psi$ (with $|\Psi|^2 = \rho_{4D}/m$) is given by
\begin{equation}
E[\Psi] = \int d^4 r \left[ \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} |\nabla_4 \Psi|^2 + \frac{g m}{2} |\Psi|^4 \right],
\end{equation}
where the first term captures kinetic (gradient) energy from quantum dispersion, and the second represents nonlinear interactions balancing self-focusing. Kinetic term includes ``suck'', ``swirl'', and ``shake'' contributions. This derives from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation $i \hbar \partial_t \Psi = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \nabla_4^2 \Psi + g m |\Psi|^2 \Psi$ via the Madelung transform ($\Psi = \sqrt{\rho_{4D}/m} e^{i \theta}$), yielding hydrodynamic equations with quantum pressure $\nabla_4 \left( \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\nabla_4^2 \sqrt{\rho_{4D}/m}}{\sqrt{\rho_{4D}/m}} \right)$. This aligns with the trinity: the kinetic term includes contributions from suck (deficits), swirl (helical phases), and shake (vortex oscillations).

To incorporate emergent electromagnetism from helical swirl (stability via phase twists $\theta = \atan2(y, x) + \tau w$), add a twist energy term:
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{twist}} = \int d^4 r \, \frac{\hbar^2 \tau^2}{2m} \, |\Psi|^2,
\end{equation}
where $\tau = 2\pi / (\sqrt{\phi} \xi)$ from minimization (detailed below). This adds ``swirl'' cost for charged vortices. This term arises from the kinetic energy of axial phase gradients, increasing the total $E$ for charged (twisted) vortices compared to neutral (untwisted) ones, providing a natural mass splitting for dark sector counterparts.

For shake (vortex oscillations), extend the functional with a term reflecting the energy of Kelvin wave modes:
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{shake}} = \int d^4 r \, \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega \, \rho_{4D} / m,
\end{equation}
where $\omega \sim v_L / \xi$ is the characteristic Kelvin wave frequency, integrated over the core volume $\sim \xi^4$. Represents ``shake'' zero-point energy. This approximates the zero-point energy of vortex modes, yielding $E_{\text{shake}} \approx (\frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega) \rho_0 \xi^3 / m$ (with $\rho_0 = \rho_{4D}^0 \xi$), tying to $E = m c^2$ as the minimum energy to sustain the deficit, where $m \approx \rho_0 \xi^3$ (core deficit mass).

To assess dynamical stability, consider the healing length $\xi$ (core regularization scale) and bulk speed $v_L$. The healing length balances quantum pressure against interaction in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation near the core ($\rho_{4D} \to 0$ over the healing length $\xi$): Setting the gradient scale $\sim 1/\xi$ and equating terms gives
\begin{equation}
\xi = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2 m g \rho_{4D}^0}},
\end{equation}
while the bulk sound speed derives from linearizing the equation of state $P = (g/2) \rho_{4D}^2 / m$ as $\partial P / \partial \rho_{4D} = g \rho_{4D}^0 / m$, yielding
\begin{equation}
v_L = \sqrt{\frac{g \rho_{4D}^0}{m}}.
\end{equation}

The core relaxation timescale is then
\begin{equation}
\tau_{\text{core}} = \frac{\xi}{v_L} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2 g \rho_{4D}^0}},
\end{equation}
where the $m$ terms cancel due to scaling in both $\xi$ and $v_L$, on the order of Planck time ($\sim 10^{-43}$ s) given calibrations like $\rho_0 = c^2 / (4\pi G \xi^2)$. This contrasts with macroscopic timescales, e.g., wave propagation $\tau_{\text{prop}} \approx r / v_{\text{eff}}$ ($\sim 200$ s for solar system) or orbital periods ($\sim 10^7$ s), yielding a hierarchy $\tau_{\text{core}} \ll \tau_{\text{macro}}$ by factors of $10^{40}$. Thus, cores rapidly equilibrate internally via quantum/sound waves, appearing steady while sourcing time-dependent fields globally.

With discrete projections, the energy functionals apply per vortex, aggregated over the density $\bar{n}$. This allows for particle-like interpretations: Vortices represent fundamental entities, with leptons as closed toroidal loops (stable due to conserved winding), quarks as braided open ends (requiring confinement via tension), and dark matter as untwisted vortices (no charge, gravitational only). The twist energy $E_{\text{twist}}$ makes charged particles heavier, providing a natural splitting, while $E_{\text{shake}}$ sources rest energy.

In braided vortex arrangements---where codimension-2 defects (P-5) entangle phase windings in the compressible 4D medium (P-1)---stability against reconnection emerges as a topological necessity. For hierarchical loops with radius ratio $x = R_{n+1}/R_n$, the golden ratio $\phi = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2$ (derived in Section 2.1.6) is not merely optimal but a requirement for survival, satisfying the recurrence $x^2 = x + 1$.

This arises from the need to avoid \textbf{resonance catastrophes}: Rational ratios $x = p/q$ induce periodic stress concentrations via resonant coupling between levels, where every $q$ rotations of level $n+1$ align with $p$ rotations of level $n$, leading to reconnections that dissipate via drainage (P-2) or bulk modes (P-3). The golden ratio's maximal irrationality---its continued fraction $[1; 1, 1, \ldots]$ converges slowest---ensures no resonances occur, providing perfect topological protection.

The self-similar expansion $\phi = 1 + 1/\phi = \cdots$ enables \textbf{scale-invariant information encoding}, making structures holographically resilient under 4D-to-3D projection (P-3, P-5, now discrete): Each level encodes identical geometric information, preserving invariants like the 4-fold enhanced circulation (Section 2.6). In the Gross-Pitaevskii wavefunction $\Psi = \sqrt{\rho_{4D}/m} e^{i \theta}$, $\phi$ ensures \textbf{incommensurable phases} across levels, preventing destructive interference and maximizing quantum coherence, akin to quasicrystal physics where $\phi$ enables stable ``forbidden'' symmetries.

Topologically, the minimal non-trivial braiding in the braid group $B_3$, with generators $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$ (adjacent strand switches), yields the ``golden braid'' $\sigma_1 \sigma_2^{-1}$. Its dilatation (stretch factor) minimizes to $\lambda = \phi$ (entropy $\log \phi$), with the recurrence $x^2 = x + 1$ emerging from the characteristic equation of the characteristic matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, whose dominant eigenvalue relates to $\phi$. This ensures stable leapfrogging-like motion without reconnection, with higher generations following Fibonacci scaling.

From information theory, $\phi$ maximizes entropy: Its unpredictability optimizes structural density without energy concentrations, balancing order (periodic instability) and chaos (dissolution) at a critical point. In 4D geometry, $\phi$ is the unique value preserving topological invariants through projection, maintaining stability despite density deficits (P-2) and enhanced circulation (P-5).

To reflect this principle, consider the effective energy for the ratio $x$: $E \propto \frac{1}{2} (x - 1)^2 - \ln x$, where the logarithmic term encodes topological stability (vortex repulsion scaling with separation, P-5), and the quadratic term reflects compressible overlap penalties near cores (P-1, P-2). Minimizing $\partial E / \partial x = (x - 1) - 1/x = 0$ yields $x = \phi$.

With the hybrid approach, braiding stability limits generations to three: For $R_n = R_0 \phi^n$, $R_3 \approx 4.236 R_0 > R_{\text{crit}} \approx 20 \xi$ (from reconnection energy $\Delta E \approx \rho_0 \Gamma^2 \ln(R_n / \xi) / (4\pi) = 0$ at critical curvature, calibrated from superfluid simulations). Higher $n$ destabilize via flows in the 4-fold projection (w-flow suppression fails), providing a topological explanation for exactly three particle mass hierarchies.

The particle mass hierarchies connect directly to this topological protection: lepton masses scale as $m_n = m_e [(2n+1)^\phi (1 + \epsilon n(n-1) - \delta)]^3$ (with $\epsilon \approx 0.0625$ from braiding overlaps, $\delta \approx 0.00125 n^2$ from curvature), as derived in Section 3, where the golden ratio governs the radius scaling to prevent reconnections. Similar hierarchies apply to quarks and neutrinos, with topological braiding ensuring stability up to the third generation.

\textbf{Fundamental Principle:} The golden ratio $\phi$ is the unique value ensuring stable, hierarchical, topologically protected vortex structures in 4D that remain coherent under 3D projection. It prevents resonant destruction, maintains quantum coherence, and maximizes information entropy, emerging as a topological necessity from P-1, P-2, P-3, and P-5. With twists and oscillations, charged vortices have higher energy, and stability limits generations to three, connecting directly to particle mass hierarchies.
