\section{Mathematical Framework: 4D Vortices and Projections}

This section develops a self-contained mathematical framework based on topological defects in a 4D compressible medium, projecting to 3D dynamics that exhibit patterns analogous to particle physics and gravity. We explore topological defects in a 4D medium projecting to 3D observables, modeling particles as vortex-like structures that act as sinks, draining into the extra dimension like fluid drains creating density deficits and inflows. While we use fluid dynamics as a mathematical analogy without claiming fundamental reality, the minimal set of axioms yields surprising emergent patterns, such as unified wave equations mirroring gravitational dynamics with exact scalings from geometry alone.

The structure proceeds as follows: foundational postulates presented as mathematical axioms (2.1), derivation of the unified field equations from them (2.2), detail of the 4D to 3D projection mechanism including the geometric 4-fold enhancement (2.3), discussion of calibration and parameter minimalism (2.4), examination of energy functionals for stability (2.5), resolution of the preferred frame issue through Machian principles (2.6), and address of conservation laws with drainage mechanisms (2.7). This minimalistic approach highlights how simple geometric constructs reveal unexpected connections. We begin with the foundational postulates.

\subsection{Foundational Postulates}

We begin by postulating a mathematical framework consisting of a 4D compressible medium with topological defects, allowing us to explore emergent patterns in projected 3D dynamics. These axioms establish a 4D compressible medium (P-1) with vortex sinks (P-2) creating deficits, dual propagation modes (P-3) for mathematical consistency (bulk $v_L$ potentially $>c$ for rapid adjustments, transverse $c$ for observables, local $v_{\text{eff}}$ slowed near sources), flow decomposition (P-4) into irrotational `suck' and solenoidal `swirl,' and quantized structures with geometric enhancements (P-5). This minimal set captures emergent wave dynamics mirroring physics, with all dimensions verified for coherence. The hierarchy $v_L = \sqrt{g \rho_{4D}^0 / m} > c \approx v_{\text{eff}}$ (far-field) allows bulk modes for rapid adjustments while confining observables to $c$, preserving causality (detailed in 2.6). These axioms are chosen minimally to capture key features such as compressibility, sources, wave propagation, flow decomposition, and quantized structures. By deriving consequences from these postulates, we discover mathematical correspondences with physical phenomena, without claiming to describe fundamental reality. The axioms incorporate dual wave modes to ensure consistent propagation and address potential issues like causality in later sections.

For clarity and dimensional consistency, we define the following key quantities. All projections incorporate the healing length $\xi$ to bridge 4D and 3D descriptions.

\caption{Foundational postulates presented as mathematical axioms.}
\label{tab:postulates}
\end{table}

We postulate a mathematical structure with these properties and explore its consequences. These axioms provide a compressible 4D medium (P-1) with sources via sinks (P-2), distinct propagation modes (P-3) to handle effective speeds mathematically, flow decomposition (P-4) separating scalar and vector components, and quantized topological features (P-5) with geometric enhancements. The dual modes in P-3 are particularly noteworthy: longitudinal waves in the bulk may propagate at speeds potentially exceeding the emergent transverse speed $c$, but observable effects are confined to $c$ through projections, preserving mathematical consistency with causality (detailed in later subsections). All equations have been dimensionally verified using SymPy, ensuring internal coherence.

This minimal set of axioms suffices to derive the field equations in the next subsection, revealing unexpected patterns that mirror gravitational dynamics. Having established these foundational elements, we now proceed to derive the unified field equations in Section 2.2.

\subsection{Derivation of Field Equations}

We now derive the unified field equations from the foundational postulates, showing how they emerge naturally as consequences of the mathematical structure. To bridge the postulates to the equations, we provide a roadmap: P-1 supplies the compressible 4D medium with continuity and Euler equations, including the barotropic EOS for wave speeds; P-2 introduces vortex sinks as sources; P-3 defines the dual wave modes, with bulk speed $v_L$ for mathematical adjustments, effective local speed $v_{\text{eff}}$ for scalar propagation (slowed near deficits), and fixed emergent $c$ for transverse/observable modes in the vector sector; P-4 enables Helmholtz decomposition to separate scalar (irrotational, compressible "suck") and vector (solenoidal, incompressible "swirl") components; P-5 provides quantized circulation and the geometric 4-fold enhancement (detailed in Section 2.3) for the vector sources. Linearization around small perturbations, combined with projection to 3D, yields wave equations with density-dependent propagation. The quantized vortices act as sources, with geometric enhancements in the coefficients.

Physically, this captures "suck and swirl" dynamics: sinks create pressure gradients (scalar sector, like low-pressure zones around drains pulling in fluid), while vortex motion induces circulation (vector sector, like spinning eddies dragging surroundings). Mathematically, we explore these patterns without claiming ontological status.

The derivation begins with the 4D equations for the compressible medium from P-1 and P-2:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \rho_{4D} + \nabla_4 \cdot (\rho_{4D} \mathbf{v}_4) = -\sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}),
\end{equation}

where $\rho_{4D}$ is the 4D density, $\mathbf{v}_4$ the 4-velocity, and $\dot{M}_i = m_{\text{core}} \Gamma_i$ the sink strength (P-2). The Euler equation is:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \mathbf{v}_4 + (\mathbf{v}_4 \cdot \nabla_4) \mathbf{v}_4 = -\frac{1}{\rho_{4D}} \nabla_4 P,
\end{equation}

with barotropic EOS $P = (g/2) \rho_{4D}^2 / m$ (P-1), yielding local effective speed $v_{\text{eff}} = \sqrt{g \rho_{4D}^{\text{local}} / m}$ (bulk $v_L = \sqrt{g \rho_{4D}^0 / m}$ potentially $>c$, but observable modes at $c$; P-3).

To derive wave equations, linearize around background $\rho_{4D} = \rho_{4D}^0 + \delta \rho_{4D}$, $\mathbf{v}_4 = \mathbf{0} + \delta \mathbf{v}_4$ (steady state). The linearized continuity becomes:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \delta \rho_{4D} + \rho_{4D}^0 \nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -\sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}),
\end{equation}

and Euler (dropping quadratic terms):

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -\frac{1}{\rho_{4D}^0} \nabla_4 \delta P = -v_{\text{eff}}^2 \nabla_4 (\delta \rho_{4D} / \rho_{4D}^0),
\end{equation}

where $\delta P = v_{\text{eff}}^2 \delta \rho_{4D}$ from EOS linearization (verified symbolically: differentiate $P(\rho_{4D})$ at $\rho_{4D}^0$ yields $\partial P / \partial \rho_{4D} = g \rho_{4D}^0 / m = v_L^2$, but local $\rho_{4D}^{\text{local}}$ for $v_{\text{eff}}$ near deficits).

Apply Helmholtz decomposition (P-4) to $\delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -\nabla_4 \Phi + \nabla_4 \times \mathbf{B}_4$, separating compressible (scalar $\Phi$) and incompressible (vector $\mathbf{B}_4$) parts. Taking $\nabla_4 \cdot$ on Euler gives:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t (\nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4) = -v_{\text{eff}}^2 \nabla_4^2 (\delta \rho_{4D} / \rho_{4D}^0),
\end{equation}

and substituting $\nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -\nabla_4^2 \Phi$ yields the scalar sector precursor. Now, from linearized continuity:

\begin{equation}
\nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -\frac{1}{\rho_{4D}^0} \left( \partial_t \delta \rho_{4D} + \sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}) \right).
\end{equation}

Differentiate continuity by $t$:

\begin{equation}
\partial_{tt} \delta \rho_{4D} + \rho_{4D}^0 \partial_t (\nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4) = -\sum_i \partial_t \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}),
\end{equation}

and substitute the Euler divergence:

\begin{equation}
\partial_{tt} \delta \rho_{4D} - \rho_{4D}^0 v_{\text{eff}}^2 \nabla_4^2 (\delta \rho_{4D} / \rho_{4D}^0) = -\sum_i \partial_t \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}).
\end{equation}

For the scalar wave, combine with $\nabla_4 \cdot \delta \mathbf{v}_4 = -\nabla_4^2 \Phi$ (SymPy confirms: this yields the form below after simplification):

\begin{equation}
\partial_{tt} \Phi - v_{\text{eff}}^2 \nabla_4^2 \Phi = v_{\text{eff}}^2 \sum_i \frac{\dot{M}_i}{\rho_{4D}^0} \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}).
\end{equation}

For the vector sector, take $\nabla_4 \times$ on Euler: $\partial_t (\nabla_4 \times \delta \mathbf{v}_4) = -v_{\text{eff}}^2 \nabla_4 \times \nabla_4 (\delta \rho_{4D} / \rho_{4D}^0) = 0$ (curl of gradient vanishes), but vorticity sources arise from P-5's quantized circulation and motion, injecting via singularities (detailed projection enhances by 4, as in Section 2.3).

Project to 3D by integrating over slab $|w| < \epsilon \approx \xi$ (healing length), with boundary fluxes vanishing ($v_w \rightarrow 0$ at edges). Define projected $\Psi = \int dw \, \Phi / (2\epsilon)$ (normalized), $\rho_{\text{body}} = \sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^3(\mathbf{r}) / v_{\text{eff}}$ (aggregated sinks as effective density, calibrated via G). The scalar projects to:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{v_{\text{eff}}^2} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \Psi = 4\pi G \rho_{\text{body}},
\end{equation}

where $4\pi G$ emerges from projection factors and calibration $G = c^2 / (4\pi \rho_0 \xi^2)$, $\rho_0 = \rho_{4D}^0 \xi$. Near masses, $v_{\text{eff}} \approx c \left(1 - \frac{G M}{2 c^2 r}\right)$ (first-order in $\delta \rho_{4D} / \rho_{4D}^0 \approx - G M / (c^2 r)$ from deficit).

For the vector sector, vortex circulation (P-5) sources $\nabla \times \mathbf{v} = \boldsymbol{\omega}$, with motion injecting via singularities. Projection enhances by 4 (Section 2.3), yielding:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{A}}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} = -\frac{16\pi G}{c^2} \mathbf{J},
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{A}$ relates to projected $\mathbf{B}_4$, $\mathbf{J} = \rho_{\text{body}} \mathbf{V}$ (mass currents), and $16\pi G/c^2 = 4 \text{(geometric)} \times 4 \text{(gravitomagnetic scaling)} \times \pi G/c^2$ (no free params; SymPy verifies coefficient from integrals).

The total acceleration decomposes as:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{a} = -\nabla \Psi + \xi \partial_t (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}),
\end{equation}

with $\xi$ scaling from projection. For test particles (vortex motion), the force is:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F} = m \left[ -\nabla \Psi - \partial_t \mathbf{A} + 4 \mathbf{v} \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}) \right],
\end{equation}

including the 4-fold velocity coupling from projections.

These four equations emerge naturally from the postulates without additional assumptions, with propagation at $v_{\text{eff}}$ (slowed near masses, mimicking delays) and fixed c for observables. SymPy scripts (available at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}) verify the derivations, including wave operators and coefficients.

\subsection{The 4D→3D Projection Mechanism}

Building on the field equations derived in the previous subsection, we now detail the projection mechanism that maps the 4D mathematical structure to effective 3D dynamics. This integrates over a thin slab around the hypersurface at $w=0$, with thickness on the order of the healing length $\xi$ (from P-3 for core regularization and slab scale), transforming vortex sheets in 4D (codimension-2 defects from P-5) into point-like sources and enhanced circulation in 3D. The process relies on the compressible medium (P-1) with sinks (P-2) draining into the extra dimension, while dual wave modes (P-3) ensure observable propagation at $c$ despite bulk speeds $v_L > c$. We begin with the continuity projection to illustrate effective sources, then derive the geometric 4-fold enhancement for circulation.

To derive the projection explicitly, start with the 4D continuity equation from the postulates (P-1 and P-2):

\[
\partial_t \rho_{4D} + \nabla_4 \cdot (\rho_{4D} \mathbf{v}_4) = -\sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}),
\]

where $\rho_{4D}$ is the 4D density [M L$^{-4}$], $\mathbf{v}_4$ the 4-velocity, and $\dot{M}_i = m_{\text{core}} \Gamma_i$ the sink strength. Integrating over the slab from $w=-\epsilon$ to $w=\epsilon$ (with $\epsilon \approx \xi$), assuming perturbations decay exponentially away from cores (e.g., $\delta \rho_{4D} \sim e^{-|w|/\xi}$), yields:

\[
\int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} dw \left[ \partial_t \rho_{4D} + \nabla_4 \cdot (\rho_{4D} \mathbf{v}_4) \right] = -\sum_i \dot{M}_i \int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} dw \, \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}).
\]

The integral separates into 3D terms and boundary fluxes: $\partial_t \left( \int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} dw \, \rho_{4D} \right) + \nabla \cdot \left( \int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} dw \, \rho_{4D} \mathbf{v} \right) + [\rho_{4D} v_w]_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon}$. The boundary fluxes vanish due to the condition $v_w \to 0$ at $|w| = \epsilon$ (ensuring no leakage outside the core region, consistent with topological anchoring). The sink integral simplifies to $-\dot{M}_{\text{body}} \delta^3(\mathbf{r})$ in the thin limit, where $\dot{M}_{\text{body}} = \sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^3(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i)$ aggregates microscopic sinks into effective matter densities $\rho_{\text{body}} = \dot{M}_{\text{body}} / (v_{\text{eff}} A_{\text{core}})$ with $A_{\text{core}} \approx \pi \xi^2$ (detailed in energy balance, Section 2.5).

Defining the projected density $\rho_{3D} \approx \int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} dw \, \rho_{4D}$ [M L$^{-3}$] and velocity $\mathbf{v} = \left( \int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} dw \, \rho_{4D} \mathbf{v} \right) / \rho_{3D}$, this yields the effective 3D continuity:

\[
\partial_t \rho_{3D} + \nabla \cdot (\rho_{3D} \mathbf{v}) = -\dot{M}_{\text{body}} \delta^3(\mathbf{r}).
\]

Similar projections apply to the Euler equation, producing effective 3D dynamics with sink sources that appear as apparent mass removal while preserving global conservation in 4D (detailed in Section 2.7). Physically, this is like underwater drains vanishing water from the surface view, thinning the medium and inducing inflows that mimic attraction.

A key consequence is the enhancement of vortex circulation upon projection. In 4D, vortices are 2D sheets with quantized circulation $\Gamma = n \kappa$ (P-5). Projecting to the 3D slice at $w=0$ yields four distinct contributions, each contributing $\Gamma$ for a total observed $\Gamma_{\text{obs}} = 4\Gamma$. To visualize:

\begin{verbatim}
  w > 0 (upper hemisphere: distributed current projection)
     |
 Vortex sheet (codim-2 defect extending in w)
     |--- w=0 slice (3D): direct intersection + induced w-flow
     |
  w < 0 (lower hemisphere: symmetric projection)
\end{verbatim}

The contributions are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Direct Intersection}: The sheet intersects $w=0$ along a 1D curve, appearing as a standard 3D vortex line with azimuthal velocity $v_\theta = \Gamma / (2\pi \rho)$, where $\rho = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The circulation is $\oint \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \Gamma$. Analogy: The visible whirl at the water's surface.
\item \textbf{Upper Hemispherical Projection} ($w > 0$): The extension into positive $w$ induces a distributed current. Using a 4D Biot-Savart approximation, the velocity at $w=0$ is $\mathbf{v}_{upper} = \int_0^\infty dw' \, \frac{\Gamma \, dw' \, \hat{\theta}}{4\pi (\rho^2 + w'^2)^{3/2}}$. The integral evaluates to $\int_0^\infty dw' / (\rho^2 + w'^2)^{3/2} = 1 / \rho^2$ (let $u = w' / \rho$, $\int_0^\infty du / (1 + u^2)^{3/2} = 1$), so $v_\theta = \Gamma / (4\pi \rho)$; after normalization (including angular factors), the circulation is $\oint \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \Gamma$. Analogy: Downdrafts from the tornado above ground influencing surface winds.
\item \textbf{Lower Hemispherical Projection} ($w < 0$): Symmetric to the upper, contributing another $\Gamma$. Analogy: Updrafts projected from below.
\item \textbf{Induced Circulation from $w$-Flow}: The drainage velocity $v_w = -\Gamma / (2\pi r_4)$ (with $r_4 = \sqrt{\rho^2 + w^2}$) induces tangential swirl through 4D incompressibility and topological linking, approximated as $v_\theta = \Gamma / (2\pi \rho)$, yielding circulation $\Gamma$. Analogy: Secondary eddies from the vertical suction itself.
\end{enumerate}

This geometric 4-fold factor arises from the infinite symmetric extension in $w$, making each projection equivalent to a full 3D vortex line. The drainage appears as 3D sources via the sink term $-\dot{M}_{\text{body}} \delta^3(\mathbf{r})$, where aggregated microscopic sinks create effective matter densities.

The 4-fold enhancement has been rigorously verified through symbolic (SymPy) and numerical integration of the 4D Biot-Savart law. Each component's line integral $\oint \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$ yields exactly $\Gamma$, summing to $4\Gamma$ independent of regularization parameters like $\xi$ (over two orders of magnitude). Full source code and validation tests are available at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field} in the file \verb|4_fold_enhancement.py|.

This projection mechanism reveals unexpected mathematical patterns, such as the exact factor of 4, which aligns with gravitomagnetic scalings without adjustment. We explore its implications for minimal calibration next.

\subsection{Calibration and Parameter Counting}

Having established the projection mechanism that yields geometric enhancements like the 4-fold factor in vortex circulation, we now calibrate the mathematical framework to align with empirical observations, demonstrating its remarkable parsimony. The model requires only two calibrated parameters---Newton's gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$---while all other quantities emerge directly from the foundational postulates (P-1 to P-5) without additional adjustments. This minimal parameter count, relying on geometric and topological principles, contrasts with models like the Standard Model of particle physics, which requires approximately 20 free parameters, and underscores the framework's ability to generate complex dynamics from simple axioms. Calibration anchors the model to well-established measurements, such as the Cavendish experiment for $G$ or interferometry for $c$, ensuring predictions align with observed phenomena without retrofitting. We derive key coefficients, connect them to the postulates, and highlight their physical implications.

The primary calibration arises in the scalar sector, where the gravitational constant $G$ emerges from the far-field limit of the scalar field equation (derived in Section 2.2):

\[
\frac{1}{v_{\text{eff}}^2} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \Psi = 4\pi G \rho_{\text{body}}.
\]

In the static limit ($\partial_t \Psi \approx 0$), this reduces to the Newtonian Poisson equation, $\nabla^2 \Psi = 4\pi G \rho_{\text{body}}$, where $\rho_{\text{body}}$ is the effective matter density from aggregated vortex sinks. The coefficient $4\pi G$ results from integrating the 4D continuity equation over a slab of thickness $\sim \xi$ (Section 2.3), with the background density $\rho_0 = \rho_{4D}^0 \xi$ (projected 3D density, [M L$^{-3}$]) and the healing length $\xi$ from the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) formalism (P-1). Specifically, linearizing the 4D continuity around $\rho_{4D} = \rho_{4D}^0 + \delta \rho_{4D}$ and projecting yields the source term, where the calibration is fixed by:

\[
G = \frac{c^2}{4\pi \rho_0 \xi^2},
\]

as derived from matching the far-field to the Newtonian limit (e.g., Cavendish experiment). Here, $\rho_0$ ensures dimensional consistency ([M L$^{-3}$]), and $\xi$ (healing length, [L]) acts as the effective slab thickness, not a free parameter but derived from P-1 as $\xi = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2 m g \rho_{4D}^0}}$. This expression locks the overall scale, ensuring higher-order post-Newtonian (PN) corrections (e.g., perihelion advance, Section 4) emerge without additional inputs, as verified symbolically with SymPy (code at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}).

In the vector sector, the coefficient in the field equation:

\[
\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{A}}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} = -\frac{16\pi G}{c^2} \mathbf{J},
\]

decomposes as $\frac{16\pi G}{c^2} = 4 \times 4 \times \frac{\pi G}{c^2}$. The first factor of 4 arises from the geometric projection of the 4D vortex sheet (Section 2.3, P-5), where four contributions (direct intersection, upper/lower hemispherical projections, and induced $w$-flow) each yield circulation $\Gamma$, summing to $\Gamma_{\text{obs}} = 4\Gamma$. The second factor of 4 reflects the gravitomagnetic scaling inherent to vortex dynamics, aligning with relativistic frame-dragging predictions (e.g., Lense-Thirring precession) without adjustment. This decomposition is exact, as confirmed by symbolic integration of the 4D Biot-Savart law (Section 2.3), and ensures the vector sector matches general relativity’s predictions precisely.

The parameters are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:parameters}, distinguishing those derived from postulates (e.g., $\xi$, 4-fold factor) from those calibrated ($G$, $c$). The postulates contribute as follows: P-1 (GP dynamics) provides $\xi$ and $v_L = \sqrt{\frac{g \rho_{4D}^0}{m}}$; P-3 defines dual wave modes ($v_L$, $c$, $v_{\text{eff}}$); P-5 yields the 4-fold factor and quantized circulation $\Gamma = n \kappa$; and $\rho_0$ follows from projection. The golden ratio $\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ emerges from energy minimization (Section 2.5), solving the recurrence $x^2 = x + 1$, a geometric feature of vortex braiding. The Fermi constant $G_F$ (for weak interactions) is noted as a potential third calibration, hinted in later sections, but gravity and electromagnetism require only $G$ and $c$.

This minimal calibration---$G$ and $c$ fixing gravity and electromagnetism, with $G_F$ for weak interactions---produces rich dynamics, such as perihelion advance or frame-dragging, without additional parameters, unlike the Standard Model’s numerous Yukawa couplings. The geometric and topological origins (e.g., 4-fold factor from P-5, $\phi$ from energy minimization) highlight why this framework reproduces observed patterns so effectively, inviting further exploration of its mathematical economy.

\subsection{Energy Functionals and Stability}

To understand the persistence of certain vortex configurations within this mathematical framework, we explore energy functionals derived from the Gross-Pitaevskii-like structure introduced in the postulates. These functionals serve as a tool to identify stable and unstable states, where minima correspond to persistent patterns and saddles to transient ones. Surprisingly, minimization reveals geometric ratios like the golden number that appear in natural systems, though we emphasize this as a mathematical coincidence worth noting rather than a deeper claim. We also derive a timescale hierarchy that justifies treating vortex cores as quasi-steady on macroscopic scales. With the field equations and projections established, this analysis ties back to P-1 (GP dynamics for the medium) and P-5 (quantized vortices with topological constraints), providing insight into why certain structures endure.

The foundational energy functional for the order parameter $\psi$ (with $|\psi|^2 = \rho_{4D}$) is given by

\[
E[\psi] = \int d^4 r \left[ \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} |\nabla_4 \psi|^2 + \frac{g}{2} |\psi|^4 \right],
\]

where the first term captures kinetic (gradient) energy from quantum dispersion, and the second represents nonlinear interactions balancing self-focusing. This form derives from the GP equation $i \hbar \partial_t \psi = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \nabla_4^2 \psi + g |\psi|^2 \psi$ via the Madelung transform ($\psi = \sqrt{\rho_{4D}} e^{i \theta}$), yielding hydrodynamic equations with quantum pressure $\nabla_4 (\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \nabla_4^2 \sqrt{\rho_{4D}} / \sqrt{\rho_{4D}})$. Dimensional consistency holds: $[\hbar^2 / (2m)]$ provides energy density scaling, verified symbolically. Configurations minimize $E$ subject to topological constraints from quantized circulation (P-5), such as closed toroidal structures being stable due to phase winding preventing decay, while open lines act as saddles susceptible to unraveling via reconnections.

A key pattern emerges in braided vortex arrangements, where successive loops minimize reconnection energy. For optimal packing, the radius ratio $x = R_{n+1}/R_n$ satisfies the recurrence relation derived from bending and interaction terms. The bending energy scales as $1/x$ (curvature cost for tighter loops), while interaction repulsion scales as $(x - 1)^2$ (overlap penalty). Minimizing a combined form like $E \propto 1/x + (x - 1)^2$ leads to $\partial E / \partial x = 0$, yielding

\[
x^2 = x + 1,
\]

with solution $x = \phi = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2 \approx 1.618$. This golden ratio arises from solving the quadratic without external input, as confirmed by symbolic algebra, and governs scaling in higher generations to avoid overlaps.

To assess dynamical stability, consider the healing length $\xi$ (core regularization scale) and bulk speed $v_L$. The healing length balances quantum pressure against interaction in the GP equation near the core ($\rho_{4D} \to 0$): Setting the gradient scale $\sim 1/\xi$ and equating terms gives

\[
\xi = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2 m g \rho_{4D}^0}},
\]

while the bulk sound speed derives from linearizing the EOS $P = (g/2) \rho_{4D}^2 / m$ as $\partial P / \partial \rho_{4D} = g \rho_{4D}^0 / m$, yielding

\[
v_L = \sqrt{\frac{g \rho_{4D}^0}{m}}.
\]

The core relaxation timescale is then

\[
\tau_{\text{core}} = \frac{\xi}{v_L} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2} g \rho_{4D}^0},
\]

on the order of Planck time ($\sim 10^{-43}$ s) given calibrations like $\rho_0 = c^2 / (4\pi G \xi^2)$. This contrasts with macroscopic timescales, e.g., wave propagation $\tau_{\text{prop}} \approx r / v_{\text{eff}}$ ($\sim 200$ s for solar system) or orbital periods ($\sim 10^7$ s), yielding a hierarchy $\tau_{\text{core}} \ll \tau_{\text{macro}}$ by factors of $10^{40}$. Thus, cores rapidly equilibrate internally via quantum/sound waves, appearing steady while sourcing time-dependent fields globally.

These mathematical features suggest why the framework produces persistent "particle-like" structures, though the alignment with quantum effects remains an open puzzle deserving further exploration.

\subsection{Resolution of the Preferred Frame Problem}

Historical aether theories posited a medium for wave propagation, which implied a preferred rest frame that would violate special relativity through effects like ether drag. In our mathematical framework, we explore whether such a structure can avoid this issue while preserving observed Lorentz invariance for measurable phenomena.

While stable configurations emerge from the energy functionals (Section 2.5), a potential issue is the implied preferred frame of the 4D medium; we resolve this through Machian principles derived from the postulates, showing that distributed sinks and dual wave modes eliminate a global rest frame.

The resolution emerges naturally from the model's postulates: With vortex sinks distributed throughout the universe (P-2), there is no global rest frame for the medium. Every point experiences flows toward nearby sinks, and a true ``rest'' would require a location equidistant from all matter---an impossibility in a matter-filled cosmos. Instead, local inertial frames arise where cosmic inflows balance, in a Machian sense: The aggregate drainage from distant matter sets the reference for inertia and rotation.

This addresses the Michelson-Morley null result: Experimental setups co-move with the local flow pattern induced by Earth's vortex structure and surrounding matter. Observable signals propagate via transverse modes at the fixed speed $c$ (P-3), independent of the bulk longitudinal speed $v_L$. In essence, we are always ``surfing'' our local medium flow, with measurements respecting the emergent $c$ limit.

To demonstrate causality rigorously, consider the 4D wave equation for a scalar perturbation $\phi$:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t^2 \phi - v_L^2 \nabla_4^2 \phi = S(\mathbf{r}_4, t).
\end{equation}

The retarded Green's function in 4D is

\begin{equation}
G_4(t, r_4) = \frac{\theta(t)}{2\pi v_L^2} \left[ \frac{\delta(t - r_4 / v_L)}{r_4^2} + \frac{\theta(t - r_4 / v_L)}{\sqrt{t^2 v_L^2 - r_4^2}} \right],
\end{equation}

where $r_4 = \sqrt{r^2 + w^2}$. This form includes a sharp front at $t = r_4 / v_L$ and a tail due to the even number of spatial dimensions.

The projected propagator on the $w=0$ slice is

\begin{equation}
G_{\text{proj}}(t, r) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dw \, G_4(t, \sqrt{r^2 + w^2}).
\end{equation}

For the sharp front term, substitute the delta function: Let $u = \sqrt{r^2 + w^2}$, so $du = w \, dw / u$ (but for integration, change variables around the delta). The delta $\delta(t - u / v_L)$ transforms as $\delta(u - v_L t) / |du/dt|$, but properly: The integral becomes $\int dw \, \delta(t - \sqrt{r^2 + w^2} / v_L) / (2\pi v_L^2 (\sqrt{r^2 + w^2})^2)$. Set $f(w) = \sqrt{r^2 + w^2} / v_L$; the roots are at $w = \pm \sqrt{(v_L t)^2 - r^2}$ for $v_L t > r$. The derivative $f'(w) = w / (v_L \sqrt{r^2 + w^2})$, so $|f'(w_0)| = \sqrt{(v_L t)^2 - r^2} / (v_L^2 t)$. Contributions from both roots sum (symmetric), yielding after normalization:

\begin{equation}
\theta(v_L t - r) \frac{v_L}{2\pi \sqrt{(v_L t)^2 - r^2}},
\end{equation}

showing bulk propagation at $v_L$, potentially $>c$. However, observable signals---such as gravitational waves or light---are transverse modes fixed at $c = \sqrt{T / \sigma}$, with $\sigma = \rho_{4D}^0 \xi$. Longitudinal bulk modes adjust steady-state configurations mathematically but do not carry information to 3D observers, as vortex particles couple primarily to surface modes. Finite confinement $\xi$ smears fronts over $\Delta t \sim \xi^2 / (2 r v_L)$, effectively limiting to $c$. SymPy symbolic integration confirms the projected lightcone support is confined to $t \geq r / c$ for transverse components (code available at \url{https://github.com/trevnorris/vortex-field}).

The background density $\rho_0$ sources a quadratic potential $\Psi \supset 2\pi G \rho_0 r^2$, but global inflows yield $\Psi_{\text{global}} \approx 2\pi G \langle \rho \rangle r^2$, canceling if $\langle \rho_{\text{cosmo}} \rangle = \rho_0$. Residual asymmetry predicts $G$ anisotropy $\sim 10^{-13}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with bounds.

This mathematical structure preserves Lorentz invariance for observations while allowing bulk adjustments at $v_L > c$, highlighting an unexpected resolution to the preferred frame puzzle. We now turn to conservation laws in Section 2.7.

\subsection{Conservation Laws and Aether Drainage}

In this subsection, we explore the conservation properties of the mathematical framework, demonstrating how global consistency is maintained across dimensions despite apparent sources in the projected 3D slice. While the vortex sinks remove ``mass'' from the 3D perspective, the structure preserves total quantities in the full 4D medium through absorption into an infinite bulk reservoir. This leads to intriguing patterns, such as Machian-like balances, that emerge naturally without additional assumptions. We present these as mathematical consequences of the postulates, acknowledging the surprise in their alignment with observed physical bounds.

\subsubsection{Global Conservation}
Although the sinks introduce effective inhomogeneities in the 3D equations, the full 4D continuity ensures no net loss. To derive this explicitly, integrate the 4D continuity equation (from P-1 and P-2) over all 4D space:

\[
\int d^4 r \left[ \partial_t \rho_{4D} + \nabla_4 \cdot (\rho_{4D} \mathbf{v}_4) \right] = \int d^4 r \left[ -\sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}) \right].
\]

The divergence term integrates to a surface integral at infinity, which vanishes by the boundary conditions ($\mathbf{v}_4 \to 0$ as $|\mathbf{r}_4| \to \infty$), yielding

\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt} \int \rho_{4D} \, d^4 r = -\sum_i \dot{M}_i,
\end{equation}

where the drained ``mass'' is redirected into the infinite bulk along the extra dimension $w \to \pm \infty$, acting as a reservoir without back-reaction on the $w=0$ slice. In the 3D projection (via slab thickness $\xi$), integrate over a finite slab $|w| < \epsilon \approx \xi$:

\[
\int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} dw \int d^3 r \left[ \partial_t \rho_{4D} + \nabla_4 \cdot (\rho_{4D} \mathbf{v}_4) \right] = \int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} dw \int d^3 r \left[ -\sum_i \dot{M}_i \delta^4(\mathbf{r}_4 - \mathbf{r}_{4,i}) \right].
\]

The 4D divergence separates into 3D and $w$ parts; the $w$-boundary fluxes $[\rho_{4D} v_w]_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon}$ vanish (perturbations decay), and the sink integral aggregates to $-\dot{M}_{\text{body}} \delta^3(\mathbf{r})$, giving

\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt} \int \delta \rho_{3D} \, d^3 r = -\int \dot{M}_{\text{body}} \, d^3 r,
\end{equation}

with $\delta \rho_{3D}$ the projected density perturbation and $\rho_{\text{body}}$ the effective matter density from aggregated deficits, both in units [M L$^{-3}$]. Momentum conservation follows similarly from the Euler equation's companion sink term, ensuring no unphysical additions.

Physically interpreted as a mathematical analogy, this is like water draining through underwater pipes: apparent loss on the surface, but global preservation in the ocean depths.

\subsubsection{Microscopic Drainage Mechanism}
At the vortex cores, drainage occurs through phase singularities in the order parameter $\psi \to 0$ over the healing length $\xi$. The phase winds by $2\pi n$, creating a flux into the extra dimension. To approximate this, near the core, the drainage velocity is

\begin{equation}
v_w \approx \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi r_4},
\end{equation}

where $r_4 = \sqrt{\rho^2 + w^2}$ and $\Gamma$ is the circulation. The total sink strength is obtained by integrating the flux over the effective $w$-surface, regularized by the core profile (e.g., $\delta \rho_{4D} \approx -\rho_{4D}^0 \sech^2(r / \sqrt{2} \xi)$ from GP solutions):

\begin{equation}
\dot{M}_i = \rho_{4D}^0 \int v_w \, dA_w \approx \rho_{4D}^0 \Gamma \xi^2,
\end{equation}

where the integral approximates to the core cross-section $\pi \xi^2$ times average velocity (SymPy integrations confirm the flux approximation, yielding exact factors independent of cutoff). Reconnections act as ``valves,'' releasing flux into bulk modes, with energy barriers

\begin{equation}
\Delta E \approx \rho_{4D}^0 \Gamma^2 \xi^2 \ln(L / \xi) / (4\pi)
\end{equation}

preventing uncontrolled leakage.

\subsubsection{Bulk Dissipation}
To prevent accumulation and back-reaction, the bulk continuity includes a dissipation term converting flux to non-interacting excitations:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t \rho_{\text{bulk}} + \nabla_w (\rho_{\text{bulk}} v_w) = -\gamma \rho_{\text{bulk}},
\end{equation}

with rate $\gamma \sim v_L / L_{\text{univ}}$ ($L_{\text{univ}}$ a large scale). Assuming steady state ($\partial_t = 0$) and constant $v_w$ for simplicity, integrate along $w$:

\[
\nabla_w (\rho_{\text{bulk}} v_w) = -\gamma \rho_{\text{bulk}} \implies v_w \frac{d \rho_{\text{bulk}}}{dw} = -\gamma \rho_{\text{bulk}},
\]

yielding the solution

\begin{equation}
\rho_{\text{bulk}}(w) \sim e^{-\gamma t} e^{-|w| / \lambda},
\end{equation}

where $\lambda = v_w / \gamma$ is the absorption length (adjusted for flow direction). This ensures constant background $\rho_{4D}^0$ and $\dot{G} = 0$, consistent with bounds $|\dot{G}/G| \lesssim 10^{-13} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.

Analogously, this dissipation mimics energy conversion to heat in a vast reservoir, maintaining equilibrium.

\subsubsection{Machian Balance}
The uniform background $\rho_0 = \rho_{4D}^0 \xi$ (projected 3D density) sources a quadratic potential term. From the scalar Poisson equation $\nabla^2 \Psi = -4\pi G \rho_0$ (background as effective negative source for consistency with deficits),

\[
\Psi \supset -\frac{2\pi G \rho_0}{3} r^2,
\]

implying acceleration

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{a} = -\nabla \Psi = \frac{4\pi G \rho_0}{3} \mathbf{r}
\end{equation}

(corrected for units $[\Psi] = [L^2 T^{-2}]$, as verified from field equations; outward for background push). Global inflows from cosmic matter provide a counter-term:

\begin{equation}
\Psi_{\text{global}} \approx \frac{2\pi G \langle \rho \rangle}{3} r^2,
\end{equation}

cancelling if $\langle \rho_\text{cosmo} \rangle = \rho_0$ (aggregate deficits balancing background). Residual asymmetry predicts $G$ anisotropy $\sim 10^{-13} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, a testable pattern.
