Streamline Integration and Bernoulli Form - Verification
=======================================================

Comprehensive verification of the streamline integration and Bernoulli form
derivation as presented in the appendix section "Streamline Integration
and Bernoulli Form".

This test validates the dimensional consistency of:
1. The Bernoulli equation from streamline integration of the Euler equation
2. The gauge choice and density-potential relationships
3. The 3D density projection formula
4. All terms in the fundamental streamline integral equation

The test is designed to reveal any dimensional inconsistencies in the paper's
mathematical framework by testing each equation exactly as written.

Based on doc/appendix.tex, section "Streamline Integration and Bernoulli Form"
(lines 35-49).

Key Equations Tested:
- Streamline integral: ∂t Ψ + (1/2)(∇Ψ)² + K ρ4D = F(t) + ∫(Ṁbody/ρ3D)ds
- Gauge choice: F(t) = 0
- Density-potential relation: ρ4D = -(1/K)[∂t Ψ + (1/2)(∇Ψ)²]
- 3D density projection: ρ3D = -(ξ/K)[∂t Ψ + (1/2)(∇Ψ)²]
