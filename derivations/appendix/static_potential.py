Static Potential: Local Closure and Small-ξ Form - Verification
===================================

Comprehensive verification of the static potential analysis including the local
closure operator, minimal model equations, Fourier space treatment, Yukawa
regularization, and small-k expansion for contact structure analysis.

This test validates the dimensional consistency of the linear operator L_ξ acting
on potential Φ, the fourth-order differential equation with ξ-dependent coefficients,
Fourier transform relationships, partial fraction decomposition, Yukawa-regularized
Green functions, and the contact structure emergence in the small-k regime.

Based on doc/appendix.tex, subsection "Static potential: local closure and its
small-ξ form" (lines 160-189).
