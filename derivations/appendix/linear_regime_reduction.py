Linear Regime Reduction - Verification
====================================

Comprehensive verification of the corrected linear regime reduction from the nonlinear
scalar field equation to the weak-field wave equation. Tests dimensional consistency
of linearization conditions, perturbative expansions, calibration relationships,
and the recovery of standard gravitational wave equations.

This test validates the corrected mathematical framework transition from the full nonlinear
vortex dynamics to the familiar linearized gravity regime, ensuring all
dimensional relationships and physical constants are correctly calibrated.

Based on doc/appendix.tex, section "Linear Regime Reduction" (lines 62-72).
Tests the corrected relations:
- δρ₃D = (ρ₀/c²)∂ₜ δφ = -(ρ₀/c²)Φₓ (dimensionally consistent)
- Standard wave equation: (1/c²)∂ₜ²Φₓ - ∇²Φₓ = 4πG ρ_body
