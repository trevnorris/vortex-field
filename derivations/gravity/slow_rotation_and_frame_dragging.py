Slow Rotation and Frame Dragging - Verification
====================================

Complete verification of all mathematical relationships in the Slow Rotation and Frame Dragging
subsection. This validates the gravitomagnetic potential equation and metric component relationships
for rotating bodies in the GEM (Gravitoelectromagnetic) formalism.

Based on doc/gravity.tex, section "Slow Rotation and Frame Dragging" (lines 45-50).

Key equations verified:
1. Gravitomagnetic potential: A_g = (2G)/(c^2*r^3) * J × r + O(J*U)
2. Metric component: g_{0φ} = -8GJ/(c^3*r)*sin^2(θ) + O(J*U)
3. General relation: g_{0i} = -4*A_{g,i}/c^3

This represents the Lense-Thirring effect in General Relativity.
