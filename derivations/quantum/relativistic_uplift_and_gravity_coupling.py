Relativistic uplift and gravity coupling - Verification
========================================================

Comprehensive verification of the relativistic generalization of quantum mechanics
within the vortex framework, including Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations with
gravity coupling through spin connections and curved spacetime metrics.

This test validates the dimensional consistency of the relativistic wave equations,
covariant derivatives with electromagnetic and gravitational gauge fields, and 
matter-wave interferometer phase calculations in curved spacetime.

Based on doc/quantum.tex, "Relativistic uplift and gravity coupling" subsection (lines 113-130).
