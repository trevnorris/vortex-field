Quantum fields and excitations of the medium - Verification
============================================================

Verification of quantum field mode expansion for scalar fields and the
associated creation/annihilation operator algebra in the vortex field
theoretical framework.

This test validates the dimensional consistency of the scalar field mode
expansion, the proper normalization factors, commutation relations for
creation and annihilation operators, and the integration measures used
in field quantization.

Based on doc/quantum.tex, "Quantum fields and excitations of the medium" section (lines 131-140).
