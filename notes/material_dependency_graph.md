# Section Dependency Report for Topological Vortex Framework

## Core Dependencies Structure

### Foundation Sections (Must Include)
**Section 2: Mathematical Framework** - The absolute foundation. Nearly every other section references:
- The 5 postulates (P-1 through P-5)
- The 4 field equations
- The 4-fold enhancement mechanism
- Basic concepts (vortices, drainage, projection)

### Primary Theory Sections (Semi-Independent)

**Section 3: Emergent Particle Masses**
- **Depends on**: Section 2 (framework)
- **Independent aspects**: Mass formulas can be understood standalone
- **Feeds into**: Sections 5, 6, 7 (all reference particle structure)

**Section 4: Gravitational Correspondence**
- **Depends on**: Section 2 (field equations)
- **Weakly depends on**: Section 3 (mass-energy equivalence)
- **Independent aspects**: GR correspondence can be understood separately
- **Feeds into**: Section 5 (quantum gravity builds on this)

**Section 5: Quantum Gravity Through Vortex Shielding**
- **Depends on**: Sections 2, 4 (gravity basics)
- **Independent aspects**: Shielding mechanism is self-contained
- **Feeds into**: Section 6 (shielding concept used for strong force)

**Section 6: Strong Force as Self-Confinement**
- **Depends on**: 
  - Section 2 (framework)
  - Section 3.4 (quark instability)
  - Section 5 (shielding concept)
- **Cannot stand alone**: Heavily integrated with other concepts

**Section 7: Electromagnetic Unification**
- **Depends on**: 
  - Section 2 (framework, golden ratio)
  - Section 3 (particle structure)
- **Independent aspects**: Fine structure derivation somewhat standalone
- **Most self-contained** of the major results

### Meta-Analysis Sections

**Section 8: Connections to Established Frameworks**
- **Depends on**: Understanding all major results (3-7)
- **Can be read independently** if reader knows the basic claims

**Section 9: Limitations and Open Questions**
- **Depends on**: Knowing what the framework claims (3-7)
- **Section 9.3** (Unreasonable Effectiveness) is fairly standalone

**Section 10: Experimental Tests**
- **Depends on**: Specific predictions from sections 3-7
- **Can extract**: Individual tests with their source sections

**Section 11: Discussion**
- **Synthesizes**: All major results
- **Section 11.4** (Why Simple Models Work) is philosophical, somewhat standalone

## Recommended Chunking Strategy

### Minimal Core Package
Always include:
- Section 1 (Introduction) - for context
- Section 2 (Framework) - for foundations

### Working Packages by Topic

**Package A: Particle Physics**
- Sections 1, 2, 3
- Optional: 7.1-7.3 (charge from twists)

**Package B: Gravity**
- Sections 1, 2, 4
- Optional: 5 (for quantum extensions)

**Package C: Unification**
- Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Requires understanding 3.4 (quarks) from Package A

**Package D: Validation & Philosophy**
- Sections 1, 2 (summaries only)
- Sections 8, 9, 10, 11
- Include brief results summary from 3-7

**Package E: Experimental Focus**
- Sections 1, 2 (key equations only)
- Section 10 (full)
- Relevant subsections from 3-7 for specific predictions

## Cross-References to Track

### Critical Equation Dependencies
- **Field equations** (2.2) → Used in 4, 5, 6
- **4-fold enhancement** (2.3) → Critical for 4, 5, 6
- **Golden ratio** (2.5, 3.1) → Essential for 3, 7
- **Shielding mechanism** (5.1) → Reused in 6

### Conceptual Dependencies
- **Vortex drainage** → Everything
- **Open vs closed topology** → 3.4, 6
- **Density deficits = mass** → 3, 4, 5
- **GP energy minimization** → 2, 3, 7

## Working with Chunks

When working on a specific section, include:

1. **The section itself**
2. **Section 2** (or at least 2.1-2.2)
3. **Any sections listed in "Depends on"**
4. **Brief summaries of "Feeds into" sections** (to ensure consistency)

### Example: Working on Strong Force (Section 6)
Include:
- Full: Sections 2, 3.4, 5.1-5.2, 6
- Summaries: Section 3.1-3.3 (for particle context)
- Reference: Field equations from 2.2

This chunking strategy should allow efficient AI-assisted work while maintaining consistency across the full document.
