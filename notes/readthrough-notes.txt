- introduction, remove quantum gravity and strong force subsections
- introduction, our approach section remove fine structure constant reference, and replace with other things we've derived.
- intro, fix reader's guide
- 


- add lambda_cosmo to table in 2.1.3
- fix xi to xi_* in description just before values table in 2.1.3
- After Table 2 it only has \xi for healing length, but I thought we had more than one healing length?
- "The 4D retarded Greenâ€™s function (see Appendix A for derivation)" is in 2.3.4, but we don't have that do we?
- "How can gravitational effects seem" is in 2.4.2 and 2.3.5. same with "causality check". This needs to be cleaned up. which one should stay, and which ones should be removed.
- should we remove Fermi constant G_F since we aren't doing that work in this paper, since we aren't doing weak force or strong force in this paper (that'll be for another paper)
- 2.7.1 has lambda_cosmo, but its never used, it also only has xi_c when there's another xi in the paper that should probably be addressed.
- 2.8 might be a little too dense. there a way to break up the subsections? it also talks about mass hierarcies. do we want to bring that up before section 3?
- 2.9 has " Section [X]", needs to be fixed
- 

- what are Kelvin waves?
- do the papers talk about photon polarization?
